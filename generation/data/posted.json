        "content": "🔍 **Fairness Stamp (FAST): A Revolution or Evolution in Hiring?**\n\nEver wonder if AI in hiring does more harm than good? Think again.\n\nIntroducing a new take on AI and fairness: **Editable Fairness**. Not just a concept but a reality with the Fairness Stamp (FAST) method.\n\nWhy should we care? Here's why:\n\n- **Ethical Recruitment**: It’s high time recruitment reflected the world's diversity accurately. The FAST method doesn't just adjust for biases; it understands and mitigates them according to our definitions of fairness today.\n  \n- **Precision in Hiring**: Gone are the days of one-size-fits-all fairness solutions. This is about customizing AI to your company’s unique diversity goals without compromising on talent quality.\n\n- **A Jump Ahead in Innovation**: By applying the FAST method, we're not just filling jobs. We're actively contributing to a more inclusive and equitable job market.\n\n**From Research to Reality**: Unlike vague claims of AI-driven fairness, the FAST method stems from rigorous research in bias mitigation. It provides an adaptable framework for debiasing AI, ensuring your talent acquisition process is both fair and effective.\n\n**How Do We Apply This?**\n\n- By setting **Editable Fairness** parameters, companies can directly influence how their AI interprets and acts on bias.\n  \n- Continuous feedback loops directly from recruitment outcomes ensure the AI's fairness remains relevant and effective over time.\n\n- A dashboard tracks and showcases the effectiveness of your debiasing efforts, demonstrating real progress in diversity and inclusion.\n\nThis isn't just another \"game changer\" in recruitment; it's an ethical imperative. **Editable Fairness** allows for direct and intentional control over the fairness of AI-driven recruitment processes, marking a significant leap from passive to active bias mitigation.\n\n**Why This Matters More Than Ever**\n\nIn a world brimming with technology and data, our ethical standards set us apart. By embracing **Editable Fairness**, we're not just making better hiring decisions; we're redefining the landscape of ethical AI use in recruitment.\n\nDebate is welcome: Is **Editable Fairness** the future we're looking for in AI-driven recruitment, or is there more to the story?\n\n#EthicalAI #FutureOfWork #InclusiveHiring",

In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation\nbenchmark BiasKE leveraging existing and additional constructed datasets, which\nsystematically assesses debiasing performance by complementary metrics on\nfairness, specificity, and generalization. Meanwhile, we propose a novel\ndebiasing method, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables editable fairness\nthrough fine-grained calibration on individual biased knowledge. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with\nremarkable debiasing performance while not hampering overall model capability\nfor knowledge preservation, highlighting the prospect of fine-grained debiasing\nstrategies for editable fairness in LLMs.",

        "content": "Imagining a world where decisions in business are backed by a seamless blend of AI's adaptability and hard logic might sound like sci-fi. But wait, what if I told you it's closer to reality than we think?\n\nPicture this: AI that doesn’t just learn but reasons, making strategic decisions clearer, faster, and more nuanced. Yet, here’s the twist – could this honestly be the game-changer we envision, or are we opening Pandora's box?\n\nThe essence lies in a groundbreaking approach: a Declarative AI-based Digital Consultant Platform, designed to elevate startups and SMEs above the fog of data overload. This isn't about feeding data and getting generic output; it's about precise, actionable insights from a complex blend of information.\n\nDelving deeper, we find:\n- **Customized Insights:** Imagine receiving strategy advice tailored explicitly to bespoke business questions. \n- **Scenario Simulation:** Navigate future paths with insights on possible outcomes, grounded in data.\n- **Adaptive Learning:** As your business landscape evolves, so does your digital confidant, offering increasingly accurate future guidance.\n- **Navigating the Regulatory Maze:** Guiding businesses through legalities, automatically updated to reflect the latest regulations.\n\nThe provocateur’s view:\nThis technological leap could paradoxically bind us in a web of complexity under the guise of precision. Is our quest for control leading us astray into an overanalyzed abyss?\n\n- The sheer complexity and breadth of decisions could freeze our intuitive action.\n- The assumption of seamless integration overlooks a stark reality: a divide between potential technological advancements and businesses' ability to assimilate them.\n\nA philosophical pivot:\nWhat if this isn't just about making better decisions but evolving our understanding of decision-making itself? This isn’t just a tool; it’s a crucible for forging business models that prioritize exploration over endpoints.\n\nSo, what's the real deal? Are we at the cusp of redefining business strategy through AI, or are we potentially complicating our decision-making fabric under the illusion of control? \n\nAre we prepared to navigate this complexity for a shot at unparalleled clarity and agility, or is the allure of advanced decision-making systems clouding our judgment?\n\nI invite you to dive into this debate - share your insights, experiences, or even your skepticism. Let's unravel this together.\n\n#AIRevolution #StrategicDecisionMaking #TechInnovation",

Well, recent research begs to differ! Dive into the vortex where Vision-Language Models (VLMs) navigate multi-step tasks through a \"chain-of-thought\" reasoning and prepare to be amazed.\n\nHere's why you need to pay attention:\n\n1) Enhanced Decision-Making: Explore uncharted territories with precision.\n2) A Radically Different Approach: Chains of thought aren’t only for humans anymore.\n3) Expanded AI Capabilities: Fasten your seatbelt as AI takes on complex tasks.\n\nDoubtful? Here’s the proof: Research titled 'Fine-Tuning Large Vision-Language Models as Decision-Making Agents via Reinforcement Learning' backs it up.\n\nThe nitty-gritty of it? The study fine-tunes VLMs via reinforcement learning, paving the way for improved decision-making capability and performance. \n\nAI is not just reproducing the results anymore. It's probing, reflecting, and reconsidering the steps in-between like never before. Take a moment to ponder on what this means for your business as AI goes beyond its conventional capacity.\n\nSimply put, our interaction with AI is set for a seismic shift. We're heeding the call for a more capable, more accessible future.\n\nWhat about you?

To address this challenge,\nwe propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then\nprompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM\nto efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final\ntext-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an\nexecutable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task\nrewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire\nVLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances\nthe decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling\n7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini.\nFurthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance\nimprovement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in\nthe overall performance of our method.",

            "summary": "Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem\nbecause the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number\nof atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical\ncompounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies\nfor generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem\nclosely resembles the \"alignment\" problem for large language models, though for\nmany chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function.\nHere, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that\nleverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective\nthat we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that\nthis algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an\nideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an\nenergy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not\nrequire reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the\nnumber of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach\nto align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified\nproperties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts\nof chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain\nexcellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the\nmethod is scalable and general.",

        "content": "Once separate entities, AI, business, and law are now intersecting with dramatic effects! The catalyst? An analysis of UK law with a Massive Language Model, Claude 3 Opus, displaying a striking precision of 87.10%.\n\nCome on this journey: Consider \"Justice Navigator,\" an AI-aided hub for legal professionals. Automated examinations and classification of summary judgment cases, delivering swiftness, productivity, and accuracy, all wrapped into one interface.\n\nNow, ponder this…\n\nWhat if AI evolved beyond a tool, becoming a client requiring legal counsel? With the surge in AI incorporation, disagreements and ethical quandaries beckon. The dynamics of legal counsel could tilt – are we prepared? \n\nOr challenge this notion: Perhaps human intelligence retains an edge over AI in the legal landscape? Could an AI model, despite its the flawless analysis, be too sterile for our uniquely human justice system?\n\nWhether strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat, AI's contract with the legal sector sparks debate, but one fact stands - the gavel has fallen and the role of AI in law is undeniably attendees.\n\nAir your thoughts on the expanding legal repercussions of AI. Are we pushing the accelerator too enthusiastically towards a time when our clientele may no longer be entirely human?\n\n#LegalTech #AILaw #BusinessFuture",

Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the\nLarge Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We\nfind that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of\n87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary\njudgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is\nnot originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings\nnot only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary\njudgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and\nAI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a\nnew and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a\nfoundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial\nadministration and computational legal research methodologies.",

Like an intense face-off, LLMs keep our software in a constant state of preparedness.\n\nWhy should you sit up and take note?\n\nConsider this:\n\n1. An intense resilience test that pushes your software to its edge.\n2. LLMs morph into constant coaches, bolstering your software’s safeguards.\n3. A creative means of turning pressure into progress.\n\nSo how can we translate this fresh concept into a subscription-based *Software Fortitude Service*? Here’s the gameplan:\n\n**Move 1: Software Pressure-Test** - LLMs mimic a war-zone scenario, introducing surgical pseudo-challenges.\n\n**Move 2: Ruggedness Roundup** - Receive a detailed strength report along with the flagged soft spots.\n\n**Move 3: Back for More** - Repeat until your software proves ready to tackle real-world hurdles.\n\nConsider this - your system, battle-ready, with its very own LLM sparing opponent. We face the fight today for a resilient tomorrow!\n\nWhat daring steps would you stake to bolster your software? Let's hear your gameplan!\n\n#TacticalFaceOff #TechOnTurbo #SoftwareResilience",

This\nsuggests the problems are not caught before the code is released, which could\nbe caused by many factors, like lack of awareness, limited efficacy of the\nexisting vulnerability detection tools or the tools not being user-friendly. To\nhelp combat some issues with traditional vulnerability detection tools, we\npropose using large language models (LLMs) to assist in finding vulnerabilities\nin source code. LLMs have shown a remarkable ability to understand and generate\ncode, underlining their potential in code-related tasks. The aim is to test\nmultiple state-of-the-art LLMs and identify the best prompting strategies,\nallowing extraction of the best value from the LLMs. We provide an overview of\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach and compare the results\nto those of traditional static analysis tools. We find that LLMs can pinpoint\nmany more issues than traditional static analysis tools, outperforming\ntraditional tools in terms of recall and F1 scores. The results should benefit\nsoftware developers and security analysts responsible for ensuring that the\ncode is free of vulnerabilities.",

        "compressed_paper": "🧬The presented research introduces a novel technique, 'Sparse Expansion', that improves the inference efficiency of a language model, like Llama 2 70B, by expanding it into a blend of sparse and specialized versions (experts) catering to specific inputs, offering inference speed-ups while maintaining accuracy. This efficiency occurs due to the 'disentanglement' of the input-output relationships of individual neurons across the input clusters. Intriguingly, the study finds that the Wasserstein distance between a neuron's output distribution and a Gaussian distribution can indicate the level of neuron 'entanglement' and its contribution to model performance. Possible 'entangled' neurons are identified in every layer of the learning model, and their sparse distribution hampers the model's performance.🧬\n",

Enhanced customer engagement and bolstered sales!\n\nBut let's not sidestep potential pitfalls. Could these 'insightful opinions' breed cognitive biases compromising model objectivity? Plus, opinions aren't set in stone - they shift. An unpredictable opinion landscape might jeopardize the RL agent’s stability, potentially wreaking havoc on the recommendation system.\n\nHowever, in our AI-rich era, human feedback plays a crucial role. Especially in areas where machines fumble with context, subtle differences, and emotional intelligence. Could this alliance foster a smoother e-commerce journey?\n\nIt’s human meets AI - a partnership chock-full of risks but ripe with revolutionary promise. How do you see this academic-strength convo starter affecting the e-comm world?\n\n#InformedAI #EcommerceNextGen #OGRLinsights",

            "summary": "Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning\nto outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text\nembedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we\nintroduce the NV-Embed model with a variety of architectural designs and\ntraining procedures to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a\nversatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and\nreproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to\nobtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream\ntask accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding\nfrom LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention\nmask of LLMs during contrastive training. For model training, we introduce a\ntwo-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive\ntraining with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives\nand curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval\ndatasets into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task\naccuracy but also improves retrieval performance. Combining these techniques,\nour NV-Embed model, using only publicly available data, has achieved a\nrecord-high score of 69.32, ranking No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding\nBenchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), with 56 tasks, encompassing retrieval,\nreranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks.\nNotably, our model also attains the highest score of 59.36 on 15 retrieval\ntasks in the MTEB benchmark (also known as BEIR). We will open-source the model\nat: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v1.",

        "content": "Swivel Your Perspective! Interesting insights from the latest research suggest an uncanny reflection of societal biases in our very own Large Language Models (LLMs). Yes, you read that right! Albeit only approximate, these biases appear in patterns related to culture, age and gender.\n\nTakes a moment to sink in, doesn't it?\n\nWhy the big deal you ask? Well, understanding these biases opens up a whole new dimension - a lens through which you could view business communication. And what if, counter-intuitively, we wielded this bias instead of batting it away?\n\nBrace yourself for an invigorating trio of radical proposals:\n\n1. Offering you the \"Cultural Consciousness Assessment Tool (CCAT)\" that scrutinises internal and external communication through the revealing spectrum of LLMs biases.\n\n2. Proffering smart solutions to counter bias, finetune strategy, and curate inclusive content that resonates with a diverse audience.\n\n3. Rolling out an innovative AI-as-a-Service model that facilitates seamless integration of cultural awareness into your business tactics.\n\nBut here's the clincher - Have you ever pondered about deliberately inducing these biases under contained conditions to assess product neutrality?\n\nChallenging conventional wisdom, introducing \"Bias Busters\"! A bold startup that audaciously capitalises on LLMs' very own bias inclination. We trap, tackle, and transform biases at their origin with surgical precision, ensuring your tech product embody fairness par excellence.\n\nSo, let's pivot our thinking and ride the wave of this disruptive approach. Let's employ our shape-shifting LLMs to expose their own bias, laying the groundwork for an inclusive tech environment.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about flipping a perceived limitation into a potential game-changer?\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #BiasesDecoded #InclusiveTechLandscape",

In this work, we introduce\nCoSy (Concept Synthesis) -- a novel, architecture-agnostic framework to\nevaluate the quality of textual explanations for latent neurons. Given textual\nexplanations, our proposed framework leverages a generative model conditioned\non textual input to create data points representing the textual explanation.\nThen, the neuron's response to these explanation data points is compared with\nthe response to control data points, providing a quality estimate of the given\nexplanation. We ensure the reliability of our proposed framework in a series of\nmeta-evaluation experiments and demonstrate practical value through insights\nfrom benchmarking various concept-based textual explanation methods for\nComputer Vision tasks, showing that tested explanation methods significantly\ndiffer in quality.",

            "summary": "In an era of rapidly advancing data-driven applications, there is a growing\ndemand for data in both research and practice. Synthetic data have emerged as\nan alternative when no real data is available (e.g., due to privacy\nregulations). Synthesizing tabular data presents unique and complex challenges,\nespecially handling (i) missing values, (ii) dataset imbalance, (iii) diverse\ncolumn types, and (iv) complex data distributions, as well as preserving (i)\ncolumn correlations, (ii) temporal dependencies, and (iii) integrity\nconstraints (e.g., functional dependencies) present in the original dataset.\nWhile substantial progress has been made recently in the context of\ngenerational models, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for tabular data\ntoday, and choosing the right tool for a given task is therefore no trivial\ntask. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in Tabular Data Synthesis\n(TDS), examine the needs of users by defining a set of functional and\nnon-functional requirements, and compile the challenges associated with meeting\nthose needs. In addition, we evaluate the reported performance of 36 popular\nresearch TDS tools about these requirements and develop a decision guide to\nhelp users find suitable TDS tools for their applications. The resulting\ndecision guide also identifies significant research gaps.",

            "summary": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to\nprovide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not\nfocus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with\nsubstantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are\nchallenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the\nembedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces\nMulti-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a\nsimple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head\nattention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching\nmulti-aspect documents. The driving motivation is that different attention\nheads can learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding\nactivations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items\nand queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide\nan evaluation methodology and metrics, synthetic datasets, and real-world use\ncases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness, showing improvements of up to 20% in\nrelevance over standard RAG baselines. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting RAG frameworks and benchmarking tools like RAGAS as well as different\nclasses of data stores.",

A color or texture change from a particular region of the edit\nimage can then be applied to other views automatically in a semantically\nsensible manner. These edited views act as an updated dataset to further train\nand re-style the 3D scene. The end-result is therefore an edited 3D model. Our\nframework enables a wide variety of editing tasks such as manual local edits,\ncorrespondence based style transfer from any example image, and a combination\nof different styles from multiple example images. We use Gaussian Splats as our\nprimary 3D representation due to their speed and ease of local editing, but our\ntechnique works for other methods such as NeRFs as well. We show through\nmultiple examples that our method produces higher quality results while\noffering fine-grained control of editing. Project page: ice-gaussian.github.io"

Welcome to the magic of Large Language Models (LLMs) spurring text-to-SQL operations.👁️\n\nThis is not a drill—it's the next step in database interaction. Thanks to LLMs, routine talk could soon be database dialect.🏔️\n\nFathom the impact of this. Sharp insights rising from a research paper, 'Next-Generation Database Interfaces: A Survey of LLM-based Text-to-SQL', weaving tales of LLMs boosting user question understanding, schema comprehension, and spawning effective SQL.🧪\n\nOn the practical side, look at SQL Oracle, a platform turning everyday language into SQL, bypassing the tech middleman. This means data access for all. Potential upheld for startups. Strong businesses. Automated customer support. Efficient, no-code/low-code SaaS applications.💼\n\nBut wait, this new arena isn't all rainbows. LLMs, potent as they are, could unleash misunderstood translations. Business decisions perched on data risk faltering when adaptation and comprehension can't keep pace with swift advances.\n\nSo, the pendulum sways between inflated expectation and realistic progress. Your thoughts? Are we merely spectators or active participants in this progress?🌐\n\nLet's engage. Let's ask ourselves: Are we prepared to decode the language of tomorrow?\n\n#LLMs #TexttoSQL #FutureofData",

It gives reasons to evaluate AI's impact in our spheres.\n\nHere's introducing EdubiasFree, an AI endeavour aiming to dissolve biases related to gender and culture in educational landscapes.

Is ignoring societal factors equal to twisting representations of personality?\n\nLet's debate - it isn't about eliminating biases, it's about recognizing them and limiting their influence. Even better, we should aim for an AI that can grow, and learn from bias-conscious system designs.\n\nUltimately, the goal should transform from resisting bias to cultivating AI that evolves in response to feedback, thus staying relevant.\n\nIsn't it high time we made AI act more human-like?\n\nReady to welcome an AI future, which is not a sanitized tabula rasa but reflective, reactive, and constantly evolving?\n\nJoin the conversation in the comments!\n\n#AIFuture #BiasInTech #ShapingTomorrow",

In this\nwork, we study the phenomenon of transcendence: when a generative model\nachieves capabilities that surpass the abilities of the experts generating its\ndata. We demonstrate transcendence by training an autoregressive transformer to\nplay chess from game transcripts, and show that the trained model can sometimes\nachieve better performance than all players in the dataset. We theoretically\nprove that transcendence is enabled by low-temperature sampling, and rigorously\nassess this experimentally. Finally, we discuss other sources of transcendence,\nlaying the groundwork for future investigation of this phenomenon in a broader\nsetting.",

These celestial entities are interconnected threads, spun into the majestic tapestry of a boundless universe. Intriguing? Let's forge ahead.\n\nDrawing from 'Demystifying Higher Order Graph Neural Networks' research, it's time to shine light on Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs). These formidable networks extend their analysis beyond individual nodes and connections, illuminating intricate, higher-order structures that often befuddle.\n\nHere's why you should take note:\n1. The capability of HOGNNs - bringing clarity to convoluted interactions.\n2. Businesses are akin to living ecosystems, thriving on interactions. HOGNNs encapsulate these interactions, their quiet influence invaluable.\n3. Their predictive aptitude – foreseeing potential opportunities and challenges with precision.\n\nHOGNNs are dynamic and versatile, swiftly adapting to escalating complexities.\n\nNow, let's venture down an unexplored path. What if we introduced intelligence into the GNNs, morphing them into Business-Embedded GNNs (BEGNNs)? Your startup, then, emerges as a dynamic living graph, continually sprouting dense nodes and connections as it evolves.\n\nTruly, smart businesses are no longer relegated to the realm of imaginative minds or sci-fi narratives, they signify an imminent change in business intelligence. Moving beyond tools, we're crafting intelligent businesses, continuing the journey of remarkable advancements.\n\nReady for an AI-facilitated future? Let's sail into tomorrow.\n\n#AIAdvancements #BusinessIntelligence #HOGNNs",

            "summary": "Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) are an important class of GNN\nmodels that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges.\nThey have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or\nover-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to\nimprove the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals.\nA plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse\nneural architectures, and even with different notions of what the\n\"higher-order\" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately\nanalyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use\nspecific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a\nblueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize\nperformance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available\nHOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights\nthat help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a\ncomprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into\nmore powerful HOGNNs.",

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized lots of fields of research.\nAlthough it is well-known that fine-tuning is essential for enhancing the\ncapabilities of LLMs, existing research suggests that there is potential\nredundancy in the fine-tuning process and therefore proposes to update only a\nsubset of parameters. However, these methods fail to leverage the task-specific\ninformation to identify important parameters during training. Based on the\ninsight that gradients inherently contain information on task-specific data, we\npropose Gradient-Mask Tuning (GMT), a method that selectively updates\nparameters during training based on their gradient information. Specifically,\nwe compute the absolute values of the gradients and apply masking to those with\nrelatively smaller magnitudes. Our empirical results across various tasks\ndemonstrate that GMT not only outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods but\nalso elevates the upper limits of LLM performance. Further analysis indicates\nthat GMT exhibits insensitivity to mask ratio and possesses computational\nefficiency comparable to vanilla SFT.",

            "summary": "It is widely acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) encode a vast\nreservoir of knowledge after being trained on mass data. Recent studies\ndisclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect\nparametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge\nprovided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a\nnovel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to\ncapitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues.\nSpecifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to\ncontext processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from\nintegrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are\nstrengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate\ncontext-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the\ncontext. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks\ndemonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling\nknowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-andplay solution that can\nbe integrated seamlessly with existing models.",

Drawing from a current study - 'Mental Modeling of Reinforcement Learning Agents by Large Language Models', we investigate the joint potential of RL agents and LLMs in reshaping eCommerce scenes.\n\nBeing forefront explorers in the digital tech space, we shine a light on two key applications:\n\n* Explainability: Layering an LLM over an RL-based recommendation system could clarify rendered suggestions in human terms, fostering trust and interaction by illuminating the system workings.\n* Real-time feedback: LLMs elucidate the RL agent's actions live, providing key insights for developers. This live response assists improving algorithms precision by directed tweaks.\n\nNow, an unexpected gambit: What if we reversed the equation, probing RL agents to decode LLMs instead? This radical shift lays groundwork for cognitive blueprinting, an approach to boost RL agents, learning from their LLM counterparts.\n\nCo-adaptation and synergy of RL agents and LLMs promises to propel AI forward - fortifying system clarity and comprehension.

            "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive success across\nmodalities such as image, video, and audio in a variety of understanding and\ngeneration tasks. However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding\nwebpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address\nthis problem, we propose Web2Code, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale\nwebpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for\nthe webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For\ndataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing\nwebpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages\nrendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and\ninstructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further\ninclude diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the\nresponses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To\nevaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework\nfor testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code\ngeneration. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial\nnot only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain, while\nprevious datasets result in worse performance. We hope our work will contribute\nto the development of general MLLMs suitable for web-based content generation\nand task automation. Our data and code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/MBZUAI-LLM/web2code.",

Introducing RankRAG, surpassing traditional models on a variety of benchmarks. Intriguing? Undeniably.\n\nJoin us, as we uncover RankRAG's superpowers:\n\n1. Sharp, accurate context ranking and answer creation.\n2. Remarkable agility to encompass new areas.\n3. Acts as an amplified analyst deciphering startup data, market trends, and user behaviour.\n4. Steering product development in tech intersections.\n\nUnarguably, this research is rewriting the script in AI advancement, reshaping elaborate business demands.\n\nNow, for a slightly rebellious notion:\n\nConsider splitting instead of merging these functions? We could build dedicated models for each task, heightening their individual productivity. Picture a relay race, each runner passes the baton to the next, concentrating on their part to enhance the whole run.\n\nSo, are we burdening these models by bundling tasks? Are we mistakenly assuming more unified tasks correspond to enhanced abilities? Could \"divide and rule\" result in improved performance across areas?\n\nIt's our moment to probe further and question more.

            "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating visual\nsignals. However, training a single model to predict noise across various\nlevels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and\nincurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss\nweighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced\nto expedite convergence. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design\nthe noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key\ninsight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise\nratio (logSNR), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is\nparticularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample\nfrequency around $\\log \\text{SNR}=0$. We empirically demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule.\nFurthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the\nImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits\ndifferent prediction targets.",
