That's what \"Generalizing Knowledge Graph Embedding with Universal Orthogonal Parameterization\" offers. Yet, here’s a twist: what if less data, not more, is the key to precision?\n\nWhy obsess over this? Well, think about these:\n\n1. Spot market opportunities invisible to the naked eye.\n2. Know your customers better than they know themselves.\n3. Innovate with data, staying leagues ahead of competitors.\n\nSounds straight from a sci-fi novel, but it's grounded in cutting-edge research. This approach flips the script on data analysis, shifting from the macro to the micro.\n\n#### The Twist: Precision over Volume\n\n- Instead of the data deluge, think laser-focused streams.\n- Master your niche by knowing the fine print, not just the headline.\n\nDare to challenge the status quo? Maybe the mantra \"more is better\" is due for an overhaul in the age of information overload.\n\n###### Could a sharper, narrower focus be the disruptor we need?\n\nHere lies the pivot: embracing minimal yet impactful data for strategic moves. It's like choosing a scalpel over a sledgehammer. This philosophy could revolutionize how we approach data, business, and innovation.\n\nLet's spark a conversation on redefining data's role in business. Are we ready to drill deeper rather than wider?\n\n#PrecisionData #InnovationMindset #StrategicInsight",

A pivot from commercial gains to social impact.\n\n4. **Quality, Not Quantity:**\n   Balancing speed with insightful, ethically aware content management. A call for innovation that integrates efficiency with societal value.\n\n**Shifting Perspectives**\n\nThis approach revolutionizes asset management, redefining efficiency by incorporating depth and ethical considerations. Let's look beyond the binary of fast versus slow and consider what it means to manage assets thoughtfully and inclusively.\n\n**The Question at Hand**\n\nCould balancing efficiency with ethical AI and deeper connection reveal a new paradigm in digital asset management that benefits not just business but society at large? \n\nLet's engage in this critical conversation.

                "summary": "The superior performance of modern visual backbones usually comes with a\ncostly training procedure. We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea\nof curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models\nusing easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training\ncurriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more\ndifficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing\neasier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing\nobservation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier\nstages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some\n'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when\nobserved through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency\ncomponents, and the natural image contents without distortion or data\naugmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the\nmodel always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the\nexposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first,\nwith harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses.

This paradigm shift, rooted in the \"Is the Pope Catholic?\" study, signals a monumental leap in digital customer interactions. Envision a scenario where bots understand the layers beneath our words, transforming every customer exchange.\n\n### Revitalizing the Customer Experience\n\n1. Real Empathy: Bots now detect frustration or joy behind customer messages.\n2. Efficiency Reimagined: Reduce the human agent workload, letting them focus on cases needing a human touch.\n3. Stand Out: Pioneer in an empathetic digital marketplace.\n\nDeep Dive: We're not just talking about AI. We're envisioning a future where bots understand sarcasm, urgency, and more, based on research findings—an LLM understanding not just what you say but what you mean.\n\n### Making It Real\n\n- Training is key: We tailor AI using specific customer interaction data and nuances of non-literal language.\n- Feedback fuels progress: We continuously refine the AI based on real interactions, ensuring relevance and empathy.\n- Human touch: A seamless transition to human agents when needed guarantees satisfaction.\n\nThink about it: AI that doesn't just respond but *feels*. It’s a game-changer for customer support, turning interactions into meaningful conversations.\n\nLet's redefine customer service together.

That's what \"Generalizing Knowledge Graph Embedding with Universal Orthogonal Parameterization\" offers. Yet, here’s a twist: what if less data, not more, is the key to precision?\n\nWhy obsess over this? Well, think about these:\n\n1. Spot market opportunities invisible to the naked eye.\n2. Know your customers better than they know themselves.\n3. Innovate with data, staying leagues ahead of competitors.\n\nSounds straight from a sci-fi novel, but it's grounded in cutting-edge research. This approach flips the script on data analysis, shifting from the macro to the micro.\n\n#### The Twist: Precision over Volume\n\n- Instead of the data deluge, think laser-focused streams.\n- Master your niche by knowing the fine print, not just the headline.\n\nDare to challenge the status quo? Maybe the mantra \"more is better\" is due for an overhaul in the age of information overload.\n\n###### Could a sharper, narrower focus be the disruptor we need?\n\nHere lies the pivot: embracing minimal yet impactful data for strategic moves. It's like choosing a scalpel over a sledgehammer. This philosophy could revolutionize how we approach data, business, and innovation.\n\nLet's spark a conversation on redefining data's role in business. Are we ready to drill deeper rather than wider?\n\n#PrecisionData #InnovationMindset #StrategicInsight",

It's smart, adaptive, unparalleled in precision.\n\nYet, enter 'SkepticNet,' a stark contrast. It doesn't accelerate; it questions, disrupts, ensuring every digital decision is foolproof, even if it means slowing down progress for precision's sake.\n\nHere lies the paradox. On one side, innovation promises unparalleled efficiency and insight. On the other, a call to tread carefully, valuing depth over speed, raising ethical queries AI's logic may overlook.\n\n'LegalMind Beacon' epitomizes the stride towards leveraging AI for cutting-edge solutions, while 'SkepticNet' serves as a cautionary tale, urging us to ponder if our rush for advancement might blind us to its consequences.\n\nThis dialogue isn't about choosing innovation over caution but integrating both to navigate the future thoughtfully. It's about balancing AI's potential with mindful consideration of its broader impacts.\n\nWhat's your take? Are we ready for this balance, or does the allure of innovation lead us astray?\n\nLet's debate.\n\n#AIethics #TechInnovation #FutureFocused",

            "summary": "Localizing oneself during endoscopic procedures can be problematic due to the\nlack of distinguishable textures and landmarks, as well as difficulties due to\nthe endoscopic device such as a limited field of view and challenging lighting\nconditions. Expert knowledge shaped by years of experience is required for\nlocalization within the human body during endoscopic procedures. In this work,\nwe present a deep learning method based on anatomy recognition, that constructs\na surgical path in an unsupervised manner from surgical videos, modelling\nrelative location and variations due to different viewing angles. At inference\ntime, the model can map an unseen video's frames on the path and estimate the\nviewing angle, aiming to provide guidance, for instance, to reach a particular\ndestination. We test the method on a dataset consisting of surgical videos of\ntranssphenoidal adenomectomies, as well as on a synthetic dataset. An online\ntool that lets researchers upload their surgical videos to obtain anatomy\ndetections and the weights of the trained YOLOv7 model are available at:\nhttps://surgicalvision.bmic.ethz.ch.",

        "content": "Ever stopped to wonder about the magic hidden in names? Here's a brain tickler: how can understanding every name across the globe unlock untold opportunities for your brand?\n\nNow, let's dive a level deeper. Why is this revelation your next business superpower? Because in a world that speaks 7,000 languages, understanding names is not just smart; it’s essential.\n\n-> Here lies the untapped potential: 1. Navigating brand identity with unprecedented multicultural insight. 2. Cutting through the maze of global intellectual rights with ease. 3. Ensuring your brand’s essence is authentically translated, anywhere and everywhere.\n\n\"ParaNames 1.0\" unravels this potential, offering a revolutionary Multilingual Brand Identity and Intellectual Property Validation Platform. Think of it as your brand’s passport to global recognition and respect, ensuring: - Multicultural name resonance across 400+ languages. - Global IP clearance, simplified. - 100% brand authenticity, irrespective of geographical borders. - Market analysis on a global scale, with a precision never seen before.\n\nHowever, imagine zooming in rather than out. Picture not a tool that scatters your brand’s seeds to the winds but one that plants them in rich, local soil, where they grow roots deep into the culture.\n\n#Enter the alternate view: 1. A brand identity that’s not just seen but felt by local communities. 2. Protection that respects the intricate tapestry of local intellectual property and culture. 3. Marketing insights that read the cultural heartbeat of your chosen locale.\n\n#The realization is two-fold: From one vantage point, we see a platform that launches brands into global orbits. From another, a tool that nestles them into the cultural fabric of local communities.\n\nBoth born from \"ParaNames 1.0\", each serving a unique vision. One broadens, the other deepens. One diversifies, the other personalizes. The question isn't which path is better but which path is right for you.\n\nThis isn’t just about where your brand could go – it’s about where it could belong. Whether aiming to resonate globally or echo profoundly within a community, the key lies in understanding names like never before.\n\nHave you considered how deeply a name can influence your brand's journey? Let’s engage in this groundbreaking discussion.\n\n#GlobalBranding #CulturalInsight #Innovation",

Yet, a staggering 76% of employees feel their workplace mental health support lacks innovation. Enter AI, poised to revolutionize this very landscape.\n\nWhy does this matter more than ever? Well, in an era where stress and burnout are par for the course, envisioning a workplace that not only supports but energizes mental wellness is critical. The twist here isn't just about offering support; it's about proactively fostering a culture where creativity blossoms from well-being.\n\nDiving deeper, let’s explore how the integration of AI, particularly GPT-4, could transform corporate mental health from reactive to proactive support:\n- **From Personalized Interaction to Creative Catalysts:** Imagine an AI that doesn’t just respond but inspires, turning daily challenges into sparks of creativity.\n- **Evolving Confidential Access into Ubiquitous Mentorship:** A chatbot that's not just a confidante but an always-available creative coach.\n- **Transforming Resource Navigators into Hubs of Collaboration:** Beyond pointing to resources, creating a space for shared innovation and understanding.\n- **Dynamic Learning as a Beacon of Collective Growth:** An AI that learns not only to improve but to evolve with the changing creative pulse of a corporation.\n\nVisualize this not just as an addition to HR but as an integral tool for R&D, innovation teams, and culture architects. This isn't just about dealing with stress but about creating an environment where mental wellness is the bedrock of innovation.\n\nThis is our call to arms: Let's not wait for stress and burnout to dictate our need for support. Let’s redefine corporate wellness as a proactive champion of mental and creative well-being.\n\nI'm curious, how do you see AI shaping the future of corporate mental wellness? Have you encountered innovation that bridges this gap?\n\n#AIWellnessRevolution #InnovationInWellness #FutureOfWork",

        "content": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – rings a bell from a science fiction novel?\n\nBut envision AGI as the unexpected player on our corporate turf.\n\nIn this share, we navigate the tangible potential and the palpable reality of AGI in the corporate arena.\n\nThree enticing trajectories agree to focus:\n1. The plausible future of AGI as a guiding beacon in Business Operations – reality or fiction?\n2. The mirror response to AGI – can the human brain be the key to corporate progress?\n3. The ethical pivot to an AGI-propelled future – are we bracing for all turns?\n\nThe thought-provoking research, \"How Far Are We From AGI,\" paves the way for an essential mediation between tech and humanity.\n\nThe aspiration of AGI paints itself as an all-inclusive maestro of corporate operations, steering strategic decisions, breeding innovation, managing logistics dynamically, and delivering bespoke customer service around the clock.\n\nYet, upon flipping the question from 'How Far Are We From AGI' to 'How Close Are We to Human Intelligence,' an enticing conjecture surfaces - AI as an enhancer, not a usurper, of human intellect.\n\nThree pivotal considerations worth noting:\n1. A corporate sphere cherishing, not supplanting, our cognitive prowess.\n2. A plot where human cognition and its galore of intricacies emerge as victors amid the AI backdrop.\n3. A universe where AGI completes its mission by enriching, not vanquishing, human intellect.\n\nLet's add another twist.\n\nThe emergence of AGI isn't solely a tech marathon. It meanders through societal adaptations, ethical incorporations, and psychological U-turns. This path arguably isn't a solo tech feat but calls for our concerted interdisciplinary endeavours.\n\nLet's therefore perceive AGI as our siblings—growing together, adapting collectively, and learning from shared experiences.\n\nNow, consider AGI as a sui generis form of intellect, one that isn't tethered by our cognitive constraints but freestyles to its distinct rhythm. Intriguing yet captivating, isn't it? Let's set sail on this compelling yet enchanting voyage.\n\n#ArtificialGeneralIntelligence #HumanIntellect #EthicsInAI #CorporateInnovation",

            "summary": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly impacted human\nsociety, driving significant advancements in multiple sectors. Yet, the\nescalating demands on AI have highlighted the limitations of AI's current\nofferings, catalyzing a movement towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nAGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with\nefficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a\nparamount milestone in AI evolution. While existing works have summarized\nspecific recent advancements of AI, they lack a comprehensive discussion of\nAGI's definitions, goals, and developmental trajectories. Different from\nexisting survey papers, this paper delves into the pivotal questions of our\nproximity to AGI and the strategies necessary for its realization through\nextensive surveys, discussions, and original perspectives. We start by\narticulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the\ninternal, interface, and system dimensions. As the realization of AGI requires\nmore advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further\ndiscuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors.\nNotably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first\ndefining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation\nframework that situates the status-quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how\nto reach the pinnacle of AGI. Moreover, to give tangible insights into the\nubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and\npotential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains. In sum, serving as a\npioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI,\nthis paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader\npublic discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI.",

        "content": "While the idea of humans and AI becoming inseparable may still seem like a far-off future advancement, that future is closer than it appears.\n\nWith the latest advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), we're witnessing profound novelties in tech-science evolution. What's exceptionally stirring is the introduction of a `Chain-of-Thought (CoT)` reasoning approach. By deconstructing complicated tasks into manageable 'thought-steps', this novel approach refines decision-making processes to a whole new level.\n\nConsider this – what if sophisticated Virtual Assistants (VAs) exploit the CoT-RL model, enhancing task efficiency drastically? What if it's not just for businesses but revolutionizes sectors like education and individual services itself? \n\nThese potent VAs, enabled by this new reasoning model, possess the capacity to deliver bespoke responses across a variety of fields, from Healthcare to E-commerce, demonstrating their versatility.\n\nEnhance this image even more. Users controlling and commanding these personalized AI agents - not limited to business solutions exclusively but becoming an aspect of their personal lives, educational experiences, molding these realms meticulously tailored to individual needs.\n\nTake a moment and envisage these potential impacts:\n\n1) A future condensed with user-manipulated, AI-assisted applications.\n2) A significant shift - an uprising in educational experiences.\n3) Personal lives undergoing a metamorphosis beyond our current comprehension.\n\nSoon, sophisticated AI could be as common and integral to our day-to-day as smartphones are today - no bounds to its potential, endless possibilities!\n\nOur world is advancing at a breathtaking pace, provoking the question - are you prepared to be an active participant in these shifts or merely an observer?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this imminent future with universal AI agents.

Imagine a platform, backed by StyloAI, that refines digital marketing strategies by distinguishing AI and human content styles.\n\nWhy is this crucial?⚠️ As AI seizes control of content creation, recognizing style variations can significantly amplify content strategy effectiveness and propel audience engagement - for anything from emails and blog posts to social media updates and press releases.\n\n💫Consider these potential benefits:\n1️⃣Enhance performance of both AI and human-generated content.\n2️⃣Provides a valuable authenticity tool for businesses relying on user reviews.\n3️⃣Acquire a competitive advantage in the digital arena. No more AI hoodwinking you!\n\nThen there's a twist! 🔄\n\nAn AI-Content Startup claims to run on AI-generated text indistinguishable from human work. Enter StyloAI, enabling businesses to sort between AI and human content. \n\nDoes this put the Startup in a tight spot?🚧\n\nWe humans crave authenticity. Consumers may lean towards content that passes StyloAI's 'human-esque' check over AI-rendered text. \n\nIn short, the advancement of AI in content creation might recoil, impacting businesses constructed around it. A bumpy ride in the tech landscape, right? 😉\n\nRemember, AI isn't retreating. But, it’s vital to continually recalibrate how we ride the tech wave. \n\nCould businesses encounter a paradox, their creation, AI, becoming a stumbling block?

A document automation bot constantly refining its capabilities. Virtual reality solutions that progressively boost their authenticity. Every bit learning from human operators' feedback, every bit consistently harnessing human corrections, all rode on the back of TRANSIC tech.\n\nBut let's flip the coin:\n1️⃣ Paddle into authentically human environments — say, education. TRANSIC could intensify learning aids for special-needs students, progressively tweaking teaching techniques tailored to their unique cognitive rhythms.\n2️⃣ What if pinpointing sim-to-real gaps isn't our only quandary? What if we let the teacher become the student, where the bots instruct us, identifying lacunas and unveiling unperceived angles from razor-sharp AI viewpoints?\n3️⃣ Let’s shake things up. Visualize emerging professions like “AI Bias Buster\" or \"Human-in-the-Loop Manager,\" all a gift from TRANSIC.\n4️⃣ Finally, let's jolt the philosophical bedrock. AI bears the potential to craft its unique 'reality,' a blend of digital comprehension and human cognition, reshaping our intrinsic notion of 'reality.'\n\nPeeling back layers of TRANSIC's potential, we're looking at everyday life, colored with a tech-aurora that elevates our routines - from education to sector-specific applications. The hope of intertwining our 'reality' with a 'sim-reality' shines at the skyline.\n\nYour views on TRANSIC's disruptive potential are paramount—engage with us!\n\n#TRANSIC #EdTech #AI #SimReality",

It's not just the thrill of technological advancement. It's about the business world reaching the cusp of an intelligence breakthrough that can enhance operations, innovation, and growth.\n\nThis research - 'How Far Are We From AGI' - unravels the loose ends, otherworldly claims, and the hard-hitting reality. 🌌\n\n- We're FASCINATED because AGI is a reflection of Human Intelligence (HI), not just another system.\n- We're CURIOUS because AGI's potential could be limitless if it emulates complex human thought processes.\n- Most importantly, we're CAUTIOUS because the very idea of AGI challenges ethical and safety boundaries.\n\nThe study conclusively states AGI is not just about mimicking human behavior. It's about learning, adapting, and evolving beyond conventional confines.\n   \nWe need to scrutinize not only what AGI can potentially achieve but also the effects on our professional landscape. \n\nAGI vs HI: A dialogue that starts optimistic, veers into dystopia, and swings back into Balance.

In\nresponse, researchers in academia and industry are actively exploring methods\nto distinguish AI-generated content from human-authored material. However, a\ncrucial question remains: What are the unique characteristics of AI-generated\ntext? Addressing this gap, this study proposes StyloAI, a data-driven model\nthat uses 31 stylometric features to identify AI-generated texts by applying a\nRandom Forest classifier on two multi-domain datasets. StyloAI achieves\naccuracy rates of 81% and 98% on the test set of the AuTextification dataset\nand the Education dataset, respectively. This approach surpasses the\nperformance of existing state-of-the-art models and provides valuable insights\ninto the differences between AI-generated and human-authored texts.",

A document automation bot constantly refining its capabilities. Virtual reality solutions that progressively boost their authenticity. Every bit learning from human operators' feedback, every bit consistently harnessing human corrections, all rode on the back of TRANSIC tech.\n\nBut let's flip the coin:\n1️⃣ Paddle into authentically human environments — say, education. TRANSIC could intensify learning aids for special-needs students, progressively tweaking teaching techniques tailored to their unique cognitive rhythms.\n2️⃣ What if pinpointing sim-to-real gaps isn't our only quandary? What if we let the teacher become the student, where the bots instruct us, identifying lacunas and unveiling unperceived angles from razor-sharp AI viewpoints?\n3️⃣ Let’s shake things up. Visualize emerging professions like “AI Bias Buster\" or \"Human-in-the-Loop Manager,\" all a gift from TRANSIC.\n4️⃣ Finally, let's jolt the philosophical bedrock. AI bears the potential to craft its unique 'reality,' a blend of digital comprehension and human cognition, reshaping our intrinsic notion of 'reality.'\n\nPeeling back layers of TRANSIC's potential, we're looking at everyday life, colored with a tech-aurora that elevates our routines - from education to sector-specific applications. The hope of intertwining our 'reality' with a 'sim-reality' shines at the skyline.\n\nYour views on TRANSIC's disruptive potential are paramount—engage with us!\n\n#TRANSIC #EdTech #AI #SimReality",

            "summary": "The expanding size of language models has created the necessity for a\ncomprehensive examination across various dimensions that reflect the desiderata\nwith respect to the tradeoffs between various hardware metrics, such as\nlatency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. There is a\ngrowing interest in establishing Pareto frontiers for different language model\nconfigurations to identify optimal models with specified hardware constraints.\nNotably, architectures that excel in latency on one device may not perform\noptimally on another. However, exhaustive training and evaluation of numerous\narchitectures across diverse hardware configurations is computationally\nprohibitive. To this end, we propose HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware language\nmodel surrogate benchmark, where we leverage weight-sharing techniques from\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) to efficiently train a supernet proxy,\nencompassing language models of varying scales in a single model. We conduct\nprofiling of these models across 13 devices, considering 5 hardware metrics and\n3 distinct model scales. Finally, we showcase the usability of HW-GPT-Bench\nusing 8 different multi-objective NAS algorithms and evaluate the quality of\nthe resultant Pareto fronts. Through this benchmark, our objective is to propel\nand expedite research in the advancement of multi-objective methods for NAS and\nstructural pruning in large language models.",
