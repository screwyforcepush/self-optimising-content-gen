That's what \"Generalizing Knowledge Graph Embedding with Universal Orthogonal Parameterization\" offers. Yet, here’s a twist: what if less data, not more, is the key to precision?\n\nWhy obsess over this? Well, think about these:\n\n1. Spot market opportunities invisible to the naked eye.\n2. Know your customers better than they know themselves.\n3. Innovate with data, staying leagues ahead of competitors.\n\nSounds straight from a sci-fi novel, but it's grounded in cutting-edge research. This approach flips the script on data analysis, shifting from the macro to the micro.\n\n#### The Twist: Precision over Volume\n\n- Instead of the data deluge, think laser-focused streams.\n- Master your niche by knowing the fine print, not just the headline.\n\nDare to challenge the status quo? Maybe the mantra \"more is better\" is due for an overhaul in the age of information overload.\n\n###### Could a sharper, narrower focus be the disruptor we need?\n\nHere lies the pivot: embracing minimal yet impactful data for strategic moves. It's like choosing a scalpel over a sledgehammer. This philosophy could revolutionize how we approach data, business, and innovation.\n\nLet's spark a conversation on redefining data's role in business. Are we ready to drill deeper rather than wider?\n\n#PrecisionData #InnovationMindset #StrategicInsight",

A pivot from commercial gains to social impact.\n\n4. **Quality, Not Quantity:**\n   Balancing speed with insightful, ethically aware content management. A call for innovation that integrates efficiency with societal value.\n\n**Shifting Perspectives**\n\nThis approach revolutionizes asset management, redefining efficiency by incorporating depth and ethical considerations. Let's look beyond the binary of fast versus slow and consider what it means to manage assets thoughtfully and inclusively.\n\n**The Question at Hand**\n\nCould balancing efficiency with ethical AI and deeper connection reveal a new paradigm in digital asset management that benefits not just business but society at large? \n\nLet's engage in this critical conversation.

                "summary": "The superior performance of modern visual backbones usually comes with a\ncostly training procedure. We contribute to this issue by generalizing the idea\nof curriculum learning beyond its original formulation, i.e., training models\nusing easier-to-harder data. Specifically, we reformulate the training\ncurriculum as a soft-selection function, which uncovers progressively more\ndifficult patterns within each example during training, instead of performing\neasier-to-harder sample selection. Our work is inspired by an intriguing\nobservation on the learning dynamics of visual backbones: during the earlier\nstages of training, the model predominantly learns to recognize some\n'easier-to-learn' discriminative patterns in the data. These patterns, when\nobserved through frequency and spatial domains, incorporate lower-frequency\ncomponents, and the natural image contents without distortion or data\naugmentation. Motivated by these findings, we propose a curriculum where the\nmodel always leverages all the training data at every learning stage, yet the\nexposure to the 'easier-to-learn' patterns of each example is initiated first,\nwith harder patterns gradually introduced as training progresses.

This paradigm shift, rooted in the \"Is the Pope Catholic?\" study, signals a monumental leap in digital customer interactions. Envision a scenario where bots understand the layers beneath our words, transforming every customer exchange.\n\n### Revitalizing the Customer Experience\n\n1. Real Empathy: Bots now detect frustration or joy behind customer messages.\n2. Efficiency Reimagined: Reduce the human agent workload, letting them focus on cases needing a human touch.\n3. Stand Out: Pioneer in an empathetic digital marketplace.\n\nDeep Dive: We're not just talking about AI. We're envisioning a future where bots understand sarcasm, urgency, and more, based on research findings—an LLM understanding not just what you say but what you mean.\n\n### Making It Real\n\n- Training is key: We tailor AI using specific customer interaction data and nuances of non-literal language.\n- Feedback fuels progress: We continuously refine the AI based on real interactions, ensuring relevance and empathy.\n- Human touch: A seamless transition to human agents when needed guarantees satisfaction.\n\nThink about it: AI that doesn't just respond but *feels*. It’s a game-changer for customer support, turning interactions into meaningful conversations.\n\nLet's redefine customer service together.

That's what \"Generalizing Knowledge Graph Embedding with Universal Orthogonal Parameterization\" offers. Yet, here’s a twist: what if less data, not more, is the key to precision?\n\nWhy obsess over this? Well, think about these:\n\n1. Spot market opportunities invisible to the naked eye.\n2. Know your customers better than they know themselves.\n3. Innovate with data, staying leagues ahead of competitors.\n\nSounds straight from a sci-fi novel, but it's grounded in cutting-edge research. This approach flips the script on data analysis, shifting from the macro to the micro.\n\n#### The Twist: Precision over Volume\n\n- Instead of the data deluge, think laser-focused streams.\n- Master your niche by knowing the fine print, not just the headline.\n\nDare to challenge the status quo? Maybe the mantra \"more is better\" is due for an overhaul in the age of information overload.\n\n###### Could a sharper, narrower focus be the disruptor we need?\n\nHere lies the pivot: embracing minimal yet impactful data for strategic moves. It's like choosing a scalpel over a sledgehammer. This philosophy could revolutionize how we approach data, business, and innovation.\n\nLet's spark a conversation on redefining data's role in business. Are we ready to drill deeper rather than wider?\n\n#PrecisionData #InnovationMindset #StrategicInsight",

It's smart, adaptive, unparalleled in precision.\n\nYet, enter 'SkepticNet,' a stark contrast. It doesn't accelerate; it questions, disrupts, ensuring every digital decision is foolproof, even if it means slowing down progress for precision's sake.\n\nHere lies the paradox. On one side, innovation promises unparalleled efficiency and insight. On the other, a call to tread carefully, valuing depth over speed, raising ethical queries AI's logic may overlook.\n\n'LegalMind Beacon' epitomizes the stride towards leveraging AI for cutting-edge solutions, while 'SkepticNet' serves as a cautionary tale, urging us to ponder if our rush for advancement might blind us to its consequences.\n\nThis dialogue isn't about choosing innovation over caution but integrating both to navigate the future thoughtfully. It's about balancing AI's potential with mindful consideration of its broader impacts.\n\nWhat's your take? Are we ready for this balance, or does the allure of innovation lead us astray?\n\nLet's debate.\n\n#AIethics #TechInnovation #FutureFocused",

            "summary": "Localizing oneself during endoscopic procedures can be problematic due to the\nlack of distinguishable textures and landmarks, as well as difficulties due to\nthe endoscopic device such as a limited field of view and challenging lighting\nconditions. Expert knowledge shaped by years of experience is required for\nlocalization within the human body during endoscopic procedures. In this work,\nwe present a deep learning method based on anatomy recognition, that constructs\na surgical path in an unsupervised manner from surgical videos, modelling\nrelative location and variations due to different viewing angles. At inference\ntime, the model can map an unseen video's frames on the path and estimate the\nviewing angle, aiming to provide guidance, for instance, to reach a particular\ndestination. We test the method on a dataset consisting of surgical videos of\ntranssphenoidal adenomectomies, as well as on a synthetic dataset. An online\ntool that lets researchers upload their surgical videos to obtain anatomy\ndetections and the weights of the trained YOLOv7 model are available at:\nhttps://surgicalvision.bmic.ethz.ch.",

        "content": "Ever stopped to wonder about the magic hidden in names? Here's a brain tickler: how can understanding every name across the globe unlock untold opportunities for your brand?\n\nNow, let's dive a level deeper. Why is this revelation your next business superpower? Because in a world that speaks 7,000 languages, understanding names is not just smart; it’s essential.\n\n-> Here lies the untapped potential: 1. Navigating brand identity with unprecedented multicultural insight. 2. Cutting through the maze of global intellectual rights with ease. 3. Ensuring your brand’s essence is authentically translated, anywhere and everywhere.\n\n\"ParaNames 1.0\" unravels this potential, offering a revolutionary Multilingual Brand Identity and Intellectual Property Validation Platform. Think of it as your brand’s passport to global recognition and respect, ensuring: - Multicultural name resonance across 400+ languages. - Global IP clearance, simplified. - 100% brand authenticity, irrespective of geographical borders. - Market analysis on a global scale, with a precision never seen before.\n\nHowever, imagine zooming in rather than out. Picture not a tool that scatters your brand’s seeds to the winds but one that plants them in rich, local soil, where they grow roots deep into the culture.\n\n#Enter the alternate view: 1. A brand identity that’s not just seen but felt by local communities. 2. Protection that respects the intricate tapestry of local intellectual property and culture. 3. Marketing insights that read the cultural heartbeat of your chosen locale.\n\n#The realization is two-fold: From one vantage point, we see a platform that launches brands into global orbits. From another, a tool that nestles them into the cultural fabric of local communities.\n\nBoth born from \"ParaNames 1.0\", each serving a unique vision. One broadens, the other deepens. One diversifies, the other personalizes. The question isn't which path is better but which path is right for you.\n\nThis isn’t just about where your brand could go – it’s about where it could belong. Whether aiming to resonate globally or echo profoundly within a community, the key lies in understanding names like never before.\n\nHave you considered how deeply a name can influence your brand's journey? Let’s engage in this groundbreaking discussion.\n\n#GlobalBranding #CulturalInsight #Innovation",

Yet, a staggering 76% of employees feel their workplace mental health support lacks innovation. Enter AI, poised to revolutionize this very landscape.\n\nWhy does this matter more than ever? Well, in an era where stress and burnout are par for the course, envisioning a workplace that not only supports but energizes mental wellness is critical. The twist here isn't just about offering support; it's about proactively fostering a culture where creativity blossoms from well-being.\n\nDiving deeper, let’s explore how the integration of AI, particularly GPT-4, could transform corporate mental health from reactive to proactive support:\n- **From Personalized Interaction to Creative Catalysts:** Imagine an AI that doesn’t just respond but inspires, turning daily challenges into sparks of creativity.\n- **Evolving Confidential Access into Ubiquitous Mentorship:** A chatbot that's not just a confidante but an always-available creative coach.\n- **Transforming Resource Navigators into Hubs of Collaboration:** Beyond pointing to resources, creating a space for shared innovation and understanding.\n- **Dynamic Learning as a Beacon of Collective Growth:** An AI that learns not only to improve but to evolve with the changing creative pulse of a corporation.\n\nVisualize this not just as an addition to HR but as an integral tool for R&D, innovation teams, and culture architects. This isn't just about dealing with stress but about creating an environment where mental wellness is the bedrock of innovation.\n\nThis is our call to arms: Let's not wait for stress and burnout to dictate our need for support. Let’s redefine corporate wellness as a proactive champion of mental and creative well-being.\n\nI'm curious, how do you see AI shaping the future of corporate mental wellness? Have you encountered innovation that bridges this gap?\n\n#AIWellnessRevolution #InnovationInWellness #FutureOfWork",

        "content": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – rings a bell from a science fiction novel?\n\nBut envision AGI as the unexpected player on our corporate turf.\n\nIn this share, we navigate the tangible potential and the palpable reality of AGI in the corporate arena.\n\nThree enticing trajectories agree to focus:\n1. The plausible future of AGI as a guiding beacon in Business Operations – reality or fiction?\n2. The mirror response to AGI – can the human brain be the key to corporate progress?\n3. The ethical pivot to an AGI-propelled future – are we bracing for all turns?\n\nThe thought-provoking research, \"How Far Are We From AGI,\" paves the way for an essential mediation between tech and humanity.\n\nThe aspiration of AGI paints itself as an all-inclusive maestro of corporate operations, steering strategic decisions, breeding innovation, managing logistics dynamically, and delivering bespoke customer service around the clock.\n\nYet, upon flipping the question from 'How Far Are We From AGI' to 'How Close Are We to Human Intelligence,' an enticing conjecture surfaces - AI as an enhancer, not a usurper, of human intellect.\n\nThree pivotal considerations worth noting:\n1. A corporate sphere cherishing, not supplanting, our cognitive prowess.\n2. A plot where human cognition and its galore of intricacies emerge as victors amid the AI backdrop.\n3. A universe where AGI completes its mission by enriching, not vanquishing, human intellect.\n\nLet's add another twist.\n\nThe emergence of AGI isn't solely a tech marathon. It meanders through societal adaptations, ethical incorporations, and psychological U-turns. This path arguably isn't a solo tech feat but calls for our concerted interdisciplinary endeavours.\n\nLet's therefore perceive AGI as our siblings—growing together, adapting collectively, and learning from shared experiences.\n\nNow, consider AGI as a sui generis form of intellect, one that isn't tethered by our cognitive constraints but freestyles to its distinct rhythm. Intriguing yet captivating, isn't it? Let's set sail on this compelling yet enchanting voyage.\n\n#ArtificialGeneralIntelligence #HumanIntellect #EthicsInAI #CorporateInnovation",

            "summary": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly impacted human\nsociety, driving significant advancements in multiple sectors. Yet, the\nescalating demands on AI have highlighted the limitations of AI's current\nofferings, catalyzing a movement towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nAGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with\nefficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a\nparamount milestone in AI evolution. While existing works have summarized\nspecific recent advancements of AI, they lack a comprehensive discussion of\nAGI's definitions, goals, and developmental trajectories. Different from\nexisting survey papers, this paper delves into the pivotal questions of our\nproximity to AGI and the strategies necessary for its realization through\nextensive surveys, discussions, and original perspectives. We start by\narticulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the\ninternal, interface, and system dimensions. As the realization of AGI requires\nmore advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further\ndiscuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors.\nNotably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first\ndefining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation\nframework that situates the status-quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how\nto reach the pinnacle of AGI. Moreover, to give tangible insights into the\nubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and\npotential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains. In sum, serving as a\npioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI,\nthis paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader\npublic discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI.",

        "content": "While the idea of humans and AI becoming inseparable may still seem like a far-off future advancement, that future is closer than it appears.\n\nWith the latest advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), we're witnessing profound novelties in tech-science evolution. What's exceptionally stirring is the introduction of a `Chain-of-Thought (CoT)` reasoning approach. By deconstructing complicated tasks into manageable 'thought-steps', this novel approach refines decision-making processes to a whole new level.\n\nConsider this – what if sophisticated Virtual Assistants (VAs) exploit the CoT-RL model, enhancing task efficiency drastically? What if it's not just for businesses but revolutionizes sectors like education and individual services itself? \n\nThese potent VAs, enabled by this new reasoning model, possess the capacity to deliver bespoke responses across a variety of fields, from Healthcare to E-commerce, demonstrating their versatility.\n\nEnhance this image even more. Users controlling and commanding these personalized AI agents - not limited to business solutions exclusively but becoming an aspect of their personal lives, educational experiences, molding these realms meticulously tailored to individual needs.\n\nTake a moment and envisage these potential impacts:\n\n1) A future condensed with user-manipulated, AI-assisted applications.\n2) A significant shift - an uprising in educational experiences.\n3) Personal lives undergoing a metamorphosis beyond our current comprehension.\n\nSoon, sophisticated AI could be as common and integral to our day-to-day as smartphones are today - no bounds to its potential, endless possibilities!\n\nOur world is advancing at a breathtaking pace, provoking the question - are you prepared to be an active participant in these shifts or merely an observer?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this imminent future with universal AI agents.

Imagine a platform, backed by StyloAI, that refines digital marketing strategies by distinguishing AI and human content styles.\n\nWhy is this crucial?⚠️ As AI seizes control of content creation, recognizing style variations can significantly amplify content strategy effectiveness and propel audience engagement - for anything from emails and blog posts to social media updates and press releases.\n\n💫Consider these potential benefits:\n1️⃣Enhance performance of both AI and human-generated content.\n2️⃣Provides a valuable authenticity tool for businesses relying on user reviews.\n3️⃣Acquire a competitive advantage in the digital arena. No more AI hoodwinking you!\n\nThen there's a twist! 🔄\n\nAn AI-Content Startup claims to run on AI-generated text indistinguishable from human work. Enter StyloAI, enabling businesses to sort between AI and human content. \n\nDoes this put the Startup in a tight spot?🚧\n\nWe humans crave authenticity. Consumers may lean towards content that passes StyloAI's 'human-esque' check over AI-rendered text. \n\nIn short, the advancement of AI in content creation might recoil, impacting businesses constructed around it. A bumpy ride in the tech landscape, right? 😉\n\nRemember, AI isn't retreating. But, it’s vital to continually recalibrate how we ride the tech wave. \n\nCould businesses encounter a paradox, their creation, AI, becoming a stumbling block?

A document automation bot constantly refining its capabilities. Virtual reality solutions that progressively boost their authenticity. Every bit learning from human operators' feedback, every bit consistently harnessing human corrections, all rode on the back of TRANSIC tech.\n\nBut let's flip the coin:\n1️⃣ Paddle into authentically human environments — say, education. TRANSIC could intensify learning aids for special-needs students, progressively tweaking teaching techniques tailored to their unique cognitive rhythms.\n2️⃣ What if pinpointing sim-to-real gaps isn't our only quandary? What if we let the teacher become the student, where the bots instruct us, identifying lacunas and unveiling unperceived angles from razor-sharp AI viewpoints?\n3️⃣ Let’s shake things up. Visualize emerging professions like “AI Bias Buster\" or \"Human-in-the-Loop Manager,\" all a gift from TRANSIC.\n4️⃣ Finally, let's jolt the philosophical bedrock. AI bears the potential to craft its unique 'reality,' a blend of digital comprehension and human cognition, reshaping our intrinsic notion of 'reality.'\n\nPeeling back layers of TRANSIC's potential, we're looking at everyday life, colored with a tech-aurora that elevates our routines - from education to sector-specific applications. The hope of intertwining our 'reality' with a 'sim-reality' shines at the skyline.\n\nYour views on TRANSIC's disruptive potential are paramount—engage with us!\n\n#TRANSIC #EdTech #AI #SimReality",

It's not just the thrill of technological advancement. It's about the business world reaching the cusp of an intelligence breakthrough that can enhance operations, innovation, and growth.\n\nThis research - 'How Far Are We From AGI' - unravels the loose ends, otherworldly claims, and the hard-hitting reality. 🌌\n\n- We're FASCINATED because AGI is a reflection of Human Intelligence (HI), not just another system.\n- We're CURIOUS because AGI's potential could be limitless if it emulates complex human thought processes.\n- Most importantly, we're CAUTIOUS because the very idea of AGI challenges ethical and safety boundaries.\n\nThe study conclusively states AGI is not just about mimicking human behavior. It's about learning, adapting, and evolving beyond conventional confines.\n   \nWe need to scrutinize not only what AGI can potentially achieve but also the effects on our professional landscape. \n\nAGI vs HI: A dialogue that starts optimistic, veers into dystopia, and swings back into Balance.

In\nresponse, researchers in academia and industry are actively exploring methods\nto distinguish AI-generated content from human-authored material. However, a\ncrucial question remains: What are the unique characteristics of AI-generated\ntext? Addressing this gap, this study proposes StyloAI, a data-driven model\nthat uses 31 stylometric features to identify AI-generated texts by applying a\nRandom Forest classifier on two multi-domain datasets. StyloAI achieves\naccuracy rates of 81% and 98% on the test set of the AuTextification dataset\nand the Education dataset, respectively. This approach surpasses the\nperformance of existing state-of-the-art models and provides valuable insights\ninto the differences between AI-generated and human-authored texts.",

A document automation bot constantly refining its capabilities. Virtual reality solutions that progressively boost their authenticity. Every bit learning from human operators' feedback, every bit consistently harnessing human corrections, all rode on the back of TRANSIC tech.\n\nBut let's flip the coin:\n1️⃣ Paddle into authentically human environments — say, education. TRANSIC could intensify learning aids for special-needs students, progressively tweaking teaching techniques tailored to their unique cognitive rhythms.\n2️⃣ What if pinpointing sim-to-real gaps isn't our only quandary? What if we let the teacher become the student, where the bots instruct us, identifying lacunas and unveiling unperceived angles from razor-sharp AI viewpoints?\n3️⃣ Let’s shake things up. Visualize emerging professions like “AI Bias Buster\" or \"Human-in-the-Loop Manager,\" all a gift from TRANSIC.\n4️⃣ Finally, let's jolt the philosophical bedrock. AI bears the potential to craft its unique 'reality,' a blend of digital comprehension and human cognition, reshaping our intrinsic notion of 'reality.'\n\nPeeling back layers of TRANSIC's potential, we're looking at everyday life, colored with a tech-aurora that elevates our routines - from education to sector-specific applications. The hope of intertwining our 'reality' with a 'sim-reality' shines at the skyline.\n\nYour views on TRANSIC's disruptive potential are paramount—engage with us!\n\n#TRANSIC #EdTech #AI #SimReality",

            "summary": "The expanding size of language models has created the necessity for a\ncomprehensive examination across various dimensions that reflect the desiderata\nwith respect to the tradeoffs between various hardware metrics, such as\nlatency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. There is a\ngrowing interest in establishing Pareto frontiers for different language model\nconfigurations to identify optimal models with specified hardware constraints.\nNotably, architectures that excel in latency on one device may not perform\noptimally on another. However, exhaustive training and evaluation of numerous\narchitectures across diverse hardware configurations is computationally\nprohibitive. To this end, we propose HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware language\nmodel surrogate benchmark, where we leverage weight-sharing techniques from\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) to efficiently train a supernet proxy,\nencompassing language models of varying scales in a single model. We conduct\nprofiling of these models across 13 devices, considering 5 hardware metrics and\n3 distinct model scales. Finally, we showcase the usability of HW-GPT-Bench\nusing 8 different multi-objective NAS algorithms and evaluate the quality of\nthe resultant Pareto fronts. Through this benchmark, our objective is to propel\nand expedite research in the advancement of multi-objective methods for NAS and\nstructural pruning in large language models.",

Allow me to explain.\n\n'Neural Operator Transformer', a recent research outcome, regulates resolution; it can both intensify and minimize it. The real kicker? There are times when less is actually more. \n\nVisualize an e-commerce platform where low-res product images morph into HD masterpieces, providing customers with an unmatched shopping experience. Or in healthcare, where an amplified view of diagnostic scans could be a game-changer.\n\nNow, let's put a spin on it - instead of demanding more pixels, appreciate the aesthetics of less. Welcome to the era of \"Pixel-Think\", where art embraces a nostalgically pixelated vibe.\n\nThen, there's data compression magic; we control the procedure, ensuring the preservation of essential information. The result? Data transmission, from the depths of space, highly classified information, or vast quantities of Big Data, has become more practicable and secure.\n\nPlus, Machine Learning models can be educated with less computational power, by utilizing lower-resolution versions of the training data! Now, that's a smart move!\n\nAs we navigate this surprisingly advanced low-res avenue, let's dare to uncover unexpected efficiencies. We're not just redefining our comprehension of digital resolution, we're discovering valuable efficiencies.\n\nOut of our journey in this pixelated landscape, what enthralls you?

Based on innovative research 'Multi-order Graph Clustering with Adaptive Node-level Weight Learning', this algorithm is set to recalibrate our understanding.\n\nHere's why: It brings to the battlefield:\n- Mighty defense against Hypergraph Fragmentation.\n- An adept hand at simultaneous Node-level motifs juggling.\n\nApplication of MOGC has potential to catapult businesses ahead:\n1. \"Adaptive Consumer Cohorts\" for Digital Marketing - Create ultra-targeted, persuasive ad campaigns.\n2. \"Start-up Network Optimization\" - Foster strategic relationships and manage precious resources.\n3. \"Product Recommendation\" - Bid farewell to generic suggestions: welcome refined, personalized shopping guidance.\n4. \"Data-driven Product Development\" - Discover breakthrough product features through insightful customer usage patterns.\n\nIncoming Twist: What if we utilize MOGC to confound data, bolstering privacy safeguards? A de-clusterizing tool for better security? Intriguing, isn’t it?\n\nBut let's pause: MOGC is a thrilling route, yet assumptions require scrutiny.\n1. What transpires when multiple motifs converge at the node level? Pure clarity or an overload of sophistication?\n2. Fragmentation: Unwanted disturbance or the vital element to expose unique patterns?\n3. What’s the aftermath of calculated weight adjustments? Focused perception or skewed interpretations?\n\nRemember, novel paths only unveil when we dare to diverge.\n\nLet’s probe further. What's your take on MOGC and its potential applications? #DataScience #DigitalInnovation #MOGC",

The paper gives evidence that they also have metacognitive\nknowledge, including ability to name skills and procedures to apply given a\ntask. We explore this primarily in context of math reasoning, developing a\nprompt-guided interaction procedure to get a powerful LLM to assign sensible\nskill labels to math questions, followed by having it perform semantic\nclustering to obtain coarser families of skill labels. These coarse skill\nlabels look interpretable to humans.\n  To validate that these skill labels are meaningful and relevant to the LLM's\nreasoning processes we perform the following experiments. (a) We ask GPT-4 to\nassign skill labels to training questions in math datasets GSM8K and MATH. (b)\nWhen using an LLM to solve the test questions, we present it with the full list\nof skill labels and ask it to identify the skill needed. Then it is presented\nwith randomly selected exemplar solved questions associated with that skill\nlabel. This improves accuracy on GSM8k and MATH for several strong LLMs,\nincluding code-assisted models.

        "content": "Prepare to journey into data clusters' heart. The 'new trendsetter' is none other than the novel model introduced in the research \"Multi-order Graph Clustering with Adaptive Node-level Weight Learning.\" Welcome MOGC, a story of adaptive learning, blending a variety of structures at node level, aiming to fine-tune how we perceive and manipulate data.\n\nArmed with flexibility and accuracy, MOGC signals a new trajectory for tech realms swimming in huge data, think social media and eCommerce. The game changer? It's unique knack to flexibly modulate the importance of diverse motifs for each node, hence enhancing data analyses and feature extraction.\n\nEnvision the potential:\n1. Refined product strategy in data startups.\n2. Customized user experiences.\n3. Comprehensive recommendation systems for eCommerce businesses.\n4. Effective predictive modeling.\n\nShift your gaze and picture MOGC in a compact data scenario - a traditional family business with deep-rooted customer insights. 'Misuse' or smart strategy adjustment?\n\nYet here's a twist – what if focusing on a single or fewer motifs hits the bull's eye in certain situations? Think companies driven by unshakeable principles - like Uber connecting drivers and passengers. Might a less diverse but sharply focused algorithm provide superior insights?\n\nAs an industry expert says, \"MOGC's adaptive learning and blending capabilities hold great promise in driving detailed insights across diverse data scenarios – hefty or petite.\"\n\nAs we wrap up this intriguing voyage, I want to hear from you. Could MOGC's algorithm's strength morph into its constraint? I invite your thoughtful discussions in this data-driven shifting landscape.\n\n#DeepLearning #DataClustering #AIResearch",

        "content": "Tap into real-time genomics, prompt in-depth diagnoses. Consider PLEIADES, armed with orthogonal polynomial basis functions, automating trading platforms, enhancing surveillance from CCTVs, or enabling smart cars to convert immediate surroundings and road conditions into better commute decisions.✨\n\nThe PLEIADES modelling class has the power to tailor traditional operations by creating temporal convolution kernels utilizing orthogonal polynomials. Efficiency and speed might be tempting, but ponder on a shift in perspective.💡\n\nInstead of constantly racing ahead, consider slowing down.🛑 Behind the hustle and bustle of rapid data processing hides thoughtful deliberation. By allowing our data to unfold over structured intervals, we lay the foundation for robust analysis and deeper decision-making.⚖️\n\nWhile speed, space-saving, and efficiency naturally grab attention, think about putting these aspects on a back seat. Picture a world of technology that celebrates in-depth data examination, prompting analysis that can lead to socio-economic impacts.🌈\n\nSure, new technologies can solve old problems, but can time-honoured wisdom solve today's challenges too? Worth a thought.🤔\n\nThinking about how PLEIADES can reimagine your operations? Let's dive into the potential insight this research offers.\n\n#PLEIADES #InnovativeTech #TemporalConvolution",

To alleviate this constraint, we delve into the paradigm of\nemploying open-source large language models as evaluators, aligning with the\nprevailing trend of utilizing GPT-4.

Well, you don't have to only envision it - it's happening now.\n\nIn a groundbreaking research piece named \"Panmodal Information Interaction\", powerful GenAI comes into play to supercharge information browsing and real-time communication. This not only makes exchanges more impactful and engaging, but it also introduces a whole new dynamic to customer data handling.\n\nPicture a tech startup, in the sphere of a digital product, wrestling with massive amounts of data. Then enters Panmodal Information Interaction, an AI-augmented CRM system that paints a detailed, real-time picture of customer behavior.\n\nWhen a business user asks, \"Who dropped a grand on our products last month?\", the system doesn't just offer a response. It suggests refined ways to exploit this data to its maximum potential.\n\nBut let's take this a step further and flip the narrative. Instead of businesses chipping away at the AI to understand customer data, what if we let the AI drive customer interaction? Envision an enhanced customer journey, with businesses capturing a wide-angle view of market trends.\n\nCould this be the remedy for businesses drowned in data overload? An AI that sieves and condenses data into tangible insights, simplifying decision-making processes.\n\nWe're not just talking about a fringe concept here. This is a fundamental shift where businesses need not struggle to interpret data. They can lean on GenAI to unearth crucial insights and construct strategies, thus focusing solely on value creation.\n\nSo, let's step back and think. The beautiful maze of data interpretation untangled by GenAI. What are your thoughts on this emerging shift? Are we ready for this revolution with GenAI leading the charge?\n\n#AIInnovation #GenAI #PanmodalInformationInteraction",

For decades, search engines such as Google and Bing\nhave been the primary means of locating relevant information for the general\npopulation. They have provided search results in the same standard format (the\nso-called \"10 blue links\").

            "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive\ncapabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, a systematic\ninvestigation of their potential in this field remains largely unexplored. This\nstudy aims to address this gap by exploring the following questions: (1) How\nare LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature? (2) Have traditional\nNLP tasks already been solved with LLMs? (3) What is the future of the LLMs for\nNLP? To answer these questions, we take the first step to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of LLMs in NLP. Specifically, we first introduce a\nunified taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen application and (2)\nparameter-tuning application to offer a unified perspective for understanding\nthe current progress of LLMs in NLP. Furthermore, we summarize the new\nfrontiers and the associated challenges, aiming to inspire further\ngroundbreaking advancements. We hope this work offers valuable insights into\nthe {potential and limitations} of LLMs in NLP, while also serving as a\npractical guide for building effective LLMs in NLP.",

We believe that the existence of these two\ndifferent modalities, and potentially many others, is creating an opportunity\nto re-imagine the search experience, capitalize on the strengths of many\nmodalities, and develop systems and strategies to support seamless flow between\nthem. We refer to these as panmodal experiences. Unlike monomodal experiences,\nwhere only one modality is available and/or used for the task at hand, panmodal\nexperiences make multiple modalities available to users (multimodal), directly\nsupport transitions between modalities (crossmodal), and seamlessly combine\nmodalities to tailor task assistance (transmodal). While our focus is search\nand chat, with learnings from insights from a survey of over 100 individuals\nwho have recently performed common tasks on these two modalities, we also\npresent a more general vision for the future of information interaction using\nmultiple modalities and the emergent capabilities of GenAI.",

Watch out - this key might open some unexpected doors too.\n\nAre we navigating towards an AI dreamland or edging towards an AI chimera? Pause. Reflect.\n\nConsider these rivals: \"TranscendAI\" versus \"UncannyAI\". TranscendAI deploys LLMs to craft advanced solutions across sectors, while UncannyAI bravely confronts potential setbacks these models could trigger.\n\nGuided by TranscendAI, picture an exciting lineup:\n\n1. **MediAid**: Language comprehension elevating healthcare outcomes.\n2. **EduMaster**: An immersive AI-buddy for personalized learning.\n3. **Legalese**: Simplifying legal jargon for all.\n4. **HoloSpace**: Transforming research into an interactive journey.\n5. **FinTorch**: A fintech titan, making sense of financial news and transactions.\n\nIntriguing? Surely. Now, let’s flip the coin.\n\nUncannyAI, our safeguard, is equipped to handle potential AI misadventures. Its ace tools, AI-Confine and Reverse Turing, detect and rectify AI-induced bias and misinformation. AI gone rogue? Not under our guard!\n\nYet, here’s a reality-check – Is AI the silver bullet we assume it to be? Could the shiny LLMs be relegated tomorrow? A dash of doubt keeps things in perspective.\n\nTime for a reality-twist! 🙃\n\nLLMs, traditionally data sifters and pattern spotters, might transition into roles as artists or philosophers! Can you think of art or music by algorithms? Disruptive? Certainly!\n\nThis leaves us with questions for the road: Are AI tutors the next big thing? What's the implications of AIs shaping our linguistics? And here’s one to ponder on: When does AI transition from being a tool to becoming the master?\n\nThe key to AI's future hangs on our choices. Will it usher in a TranscendAI revolution or an UncannyAI cautionary tale? Eager to steer the AI conversation? Drop your thoughts below.\n\n#AI #Innovation #LargeLanguageModels",

A fascinating convergence of legal AI technology showcased in \"Topic Modelling Case Law Using a Large Language Model and a New Taxonomy for UK Law: AI Insights into Summary Judgment.\"\n\nSifting through this study, we brush up against the untapped capabilities of the impressive Claude 3 Opus. A mighty Large Language Model, it promises to recalibrate our approach to legal chores and services.\n\nPeering from a broader vantage point, three takeaways stand tall:\n1. AI-Driven Legal Research \n2. Predictive Legal Analytics\n3. AI-Powered Legal Consultation\n\nEnvision an **AI-Driven Legal Research** tool, eliminating the often grueling chase through case law for a path of clarity, efficiency, and precision.\n\nDare to think of a time where **Predictive Analytics** divulge insights into case outcomes, enabling legal advice givers to forecast verdicts with an accuracy worthy of Nostradamus.\n\nEntertain the possibility of an **AI-Powered Legal Consultation**, where extensive meetings shrink, a welcome alternative for businesses seeking swift and streamlined legal direction.\n\nWhile the allure of efficiency is quite attractive, this technological tide doesn't arrive void of concerns. Could the rise of AI predict a dimming of traditional legal roles? Might predictive analytics inadvertently anchor ingrained biases or curb the creative edge of legal practitioners? Would automated advice systems truly amplify legal understanding while ensuring the delicate delivery of advice necessary for clients?\n\nWith these thoughts in focus, it underscores the need to navigate this conjugal dance of AI and law with mindful regulations and planning.\n\nYour viewpoint could help paint this canvas. How do you perceive the equilibrium between the advantages and challenges ushered in by this legal tech metamorphosis?\n\n#LegalTech #AI #FutureofLaw",

Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the\nLarge Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We\nfind that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of\n87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary\njudgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is\nnot originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings\nnot only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary\njudgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and\nAI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a\nnew and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a\nfoundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial\nadministration and computational legal research methodologies.",

We're keeping things direct here...\n\nHot off the press is an interesting workaround in dialogue systems - meet Adversarial DPO (ADPO). It's a firm stride for minimizing AI dialogue toxicity without sacrificing wit and charisma.\n\nLet's percolate this down further:\n\n1️. Education technology: mastering debate minus the toxicity.\n2️. Mental health support apps: a cautious and gracious approach to challenging talks.\n3️. Retail: top-tier user experiences with a poised AI assistant.\n4️. HR: creating first impressions that respect all contenders.\n\nNow, let's spin the wheel. Picture an industry that doesn't just deliver 'detoxed' AI dialogues as a bonus, but weaves it into its core product - AI toxicity-filtering. A service spanning industries to scrub toxic elements from AI processes. \n\nAnd here's the twist: why not consider ADPO to foster polite exchanges between AIs too? A reshaping of norms, don't you think?\n\nSo, how do you envision the future of AI interactions? Can't wait to hear your insights!\n\n#AI #WaveOfChange #FutureOfAI",

        "content": "🌐 Welcome HoneySec - the confluence of AI, BIoT, and strategic deception that redefines enterprise defense. \n\nRiding on the surge of IoT usage, HoneySec meets the escalating demand for advanced security services; a path to effective cyber risk mitigation, carved by cutting-edge technology and inventiveness.\n\nExplore why HoneySec emerges as a definitive arrow in the cybersecurity quiver:\n🔹 Seamlessly fuses AI and BIoT, fostering a proactive defensive mechanism.\n🔹 Strategically deploys honeypots based on advanced research, adding an unexpected armor in our security arsenal.\n🔹 Recasts traditional defense techniques through innovative deception maneuvers.\n\nMerging a Bayesian game-theoretic model with an AI-driven Intrusion Detection System, HoneySec intuitively outwits threats, always staying one leap ahead. Nodes cleverly masquerade as decoys, confounding cyberattacks with an intricate disguise to pre-empt and repel threats.\n\nHoneySec's exceptional ability isn't static; it persistently adapts, learns, and equips itself to tackle the continually transforming cyber threat arena.\n\nConsider this gripping twist: visualize each BIoT device as a default honeypot, captivating yet perilous for intruders. We aren't merely talking about reinforcing defenses, but an audacious flip in approach where we wield our vulnerabilities as our ultimate power!\n\nThe essence of cybersecurity now pivots to outsmarting the nemesis, guiding them into an artfully constructed labyrinth of traps. This avant-garde realization sees fortified security as an ingeniously crafted maze, outfitted to not merely obstruct, but to confound, misdirect, and ultimately trap potential threats.\n\nEngagement time! Rethink: can we perceive vulnerability as a strength in cybersecurity? Your thoughts are encouraged and welcome.\n\n#HoneySec #BIoT #CyberSecurity",

This\nmodel enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to\nsuspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The\npaper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the\nAI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games.\nThe model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that\nmay initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized\nhoneypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack\npatterns.",

        "content": "🎯Countless times we've pondered - could AI serve as legal counsel? And who takes precedence – the business magnate or Mr. Average? Time to dig in...\n\nThe world of law was given a jolt by a recent study: \"Topic Modelling Case Law Using a Large Language Model and a New Taxonomy for UK Law: AI Insights into Summary Judgment\". This investigation employs Claude 3 Opus, a Large Language Model, to dissect UK law, scoring an impressive 87.10% precision. \n\n💡Here's a spark. Merge this tech with our business pursuits, birthing a unique asset – an AI-fortified \"Legal Assistance Platform\". Tailored for experts, this could fast-track legal analysis, trend forecasts, and beyond.\n\nYet, an alternate view is taking shape – a guiding light for the layman straddling the maze of law.\n\nThat guide - \"Everyman's Legal Assistant\". By teaching Claude 3 Opus to decipher laws and offer advice, we breed an adept system that untangles legal knots for, let's say, somebody slapped with a parking fine.\n\nUnraveling the layers:\n1. Legal advice becomes accessible - clarifying law jargon.\n2. Empowers typical folks to take legal matters into their own hands. \n3. Possible user-friendly design, akin to an app!\n\nOn the brink of a divergence, AI in hand. Which trail do we illuminate - business moguls or common folks? Or should we find a path that embraces both?\n\n💭Your thoughts? How would you steer AI's role in our legal landscape?\n\n#AILaw #DisruptingLegality #AccessibleLaw",

            "summary": "Predictive Maintenance (PdM) emerged as one of the pillars of Industry 4.0,\nand became crucial for enhancing operational efficiency, allowing to minimize\ndowntime, extend lifespan of equipment, and prevent failures. A wide range of\nPdM tasks can be performed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, which\noften use data generated from industrial sensors. The steel industry, which is\nan important branch of the global economy, is one of the potential\nbeneficiaries of this trend, given its large environmental footprint, the\nglobalized nature of the market, and the demanding working conditions. This\nsurvey synthesizes the current state of knowledge in the field of AI-based PdM\nwithin the steel industry and is addressed to researchers and practitioners. We\nidentified 219 articles related to this topic and formulated five research\nquestions, allowing us to gain a global perspective on current trends and the\nmain research gaps. We examined equipment and facilities subjected to PdM,\ndetermined common PdM approaches, and identified trends in the AI methods used\nto develop these solutions. We explored the characteristics of the data used in\nthe surveyed articles and assessed the practical implications of the research\npresented there. Most of the research focuses on the blast furnace or hot\nrolling, using data from industrial sensors. Current trends show increasing\ninterest in the domain, especially in the use of deep learning. The main\nchallenges include implementing the proposed methods in a production\nenvironment, incorporating them into maintenance plans, and enhancing the\naccessibility and reproducibility of the research.",

        "content": "Envision AI being the key to unlocking effective talent acquisition and team optimization? Brace yourself for a reality where a digital algorithm teases apart your unique team role, prescribes a bespoke pathway for skill amplification and wades through the murky waters of collaboration prospects!\n\n\"The advent of AI crossing paths with HR is an untapped expanse calling for trailblazers\". Taking flight from this concept is the freshly unveiled research - \"ExES - Explaining Expert Search and Team Formation Systems\". Shedding light on the maze of team formations and project assignments, the study introduces concepts heavily seasoned with explainable AI, proffering both factual and alternate hypotheses about integral skills and collaborations.\n\nAt the crux of this breakthrough lies \"SkillMatrix\", its influence echoing across the cut-throat world of corporations. Yet, it's not your conventional professional networking apparatus, Rather, it's a mechanism indicating why a specific individual was chosen or passed up for a project. Revealing \"Transparency of choice, Direction for advancement, and a Sphere of collaboration prospects.\"\n\nBut what happens when we extend our gaze beyond corporate confines to view it as a learning platform? Toppling the firm walls of traditional learning, blending tech prowess and broad spectrum knowledge sharing. A tool that deconstructs rather than builds. A quiet evolution underway.\n\nWhy restrain this tool to boardroom confines? What if we entrusted this avant-garde technology to the workforce? Would they master the art of steering their career vessel with the guiding wind of ExES by their side? A potential perk waiting to breach the surface.\n\nWhat if we nudged the boundaries of the everyday, and the tool played up employees' dormant skills rather than sticking to job specifications? A surge of unforeseen project strides on the horizon!\n\nYet, consider this: every innovation presents a myriad of ethical and practical implications. Opening a Pandora's box of detailed evaluations, bias probes, and employee motivation inquiries.\n\nSo, do we dare to take part in this journey of reshaping traditional team building with \"SkillMatrix?\" Do we move into this future with open-eyed anticipation?\n\n**#AIinRecruitment #InnovativeTeamBuilding #ExplainableAI**",

Given a keyword query corresponding to\nthe desired skills, these systems identify experts that best match the query.\nHowever, state-of-the-art solutions to this problem lack transparency. To\naddress this issue, we propose ExES, a tool designed to explain expert search\nand team formation systems using factual and counterfactual methods from the\nfield of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). ExES uses factual\nexplanations to highlight important skills and collaborations, and\ncounterfactual explanations to suggest new skills and collaborations to\nincrease the likelihood of being identified as an expert. Towards a practical\ndeployment as an interactive explanation tool, we present and experimentally\nevaluate a suite of pruning strategies to speed up the explanation search. In\nmany cases, our pruning strategies make ExES an order of magnitude faster than\nexhaustive search, while still producing concise and actionable explanations.",

We're turning the dial of AI conversations, sparking life into an intense tussle between contrasting language model titans. Captivated yet?\n\nWith this seismic shift, we're witnessing a movement for more than just size. It's a focus on quality, precision, efficiency.\n\n⭐Let's highlight the key players you'd likely root for:\n    \n   — A 24/7 Digital Assistant enhancing client communication\n   — An Automated Analyst serving up concise business metrics\n   — A Real-Time Market Researcher feeding trending data\n   — A Brand Storyteller crafting compelling stories\n   — A Trend Forecaster predicting market movement\n\nNow, the plot thickens: consider these models downsized. Seems illogical? But speculate on fine-tuned SLMs streamlined for your specific sector.\n\nTake your business analytics experience up a notch with a proficient SLM, untangling complex metrics with a nimbleness that might leave even the strongest LLMs behind.\n\nAs we question the dominance of LLMs, we also encourage a renewed focus on data quality and energy efficiency rather than mere size.\n\nIn a world hinged on AI, isn't it time we explored a harmonious blend of AI capabilities with human skills for enhanced synergy?\n\nProvocative perspectives, rousing possibilities, and the dynamic mural of AI in business. Buckled up for the AI thrill ride?\n\nLet’s hear from you! Are you team LLM or SLM? How are you harnessing AI in your business ambit?\n\n#LargeLanguageModels #SmallLanguageModels #AISurge",

            "summary": "In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments,\nmammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world\nand continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models\n(LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to\nefficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after\npre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework\ninspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable\ndeeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG\nsynergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized\nPageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in\nhuman memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop\nquestion answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves\ncomparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while\nbeing 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into\nIRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can\ntackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code\nand data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.",

Amplifies consumer engagement\n2. Tailors user experience \n3. Reveals deep-seated consumer insights.\n\nLet's weave in a challenge to the conventional and consider ✨two creatively twisted scenarios✨ for a potential startup:\n\n✨ \"Personalias\" - A venture that integrates adaptable digital products with a 'Digital Chameleon.' This chatbot adapts subtly to the user's linguistic cues, cultural nuances, and premises. Unlike its precursors, it dances on ethical principles, guarding against bias.\n\n✨\"Reflect.AI\" - Here, technology acts as a 'Mirror' with AI algorithms taking centre stage. Instead of adapting from implicit cues, this AI encourages introspection, alerting users to their implicit biases in language usage.\n\nIn light of 'Implicit Personalization,' AI evolves from a mere instrument to a catalyst stimulating disruption, inclusivity, and enhanced customer relationships.\n\nAs we venture forward, we're posed with a shifting question: Are we witnessing the rise of 'AI-Assisted Introspection'?\n\nI invite you to share your insights and perspectives on the future of AI.\n\n#AI #Personalisation #EthicalAI #LanguageModels",

Brace yourselves for a digital landscape that not only hears, but keeps track.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\n1. Imagine your chatbot sidekick suddenly boasting an elephant's memory, never repeating questions to your clients.\n2. An AI analyzing data at lightning speed, letting you enjoy some elusive downtime.\n3. Multicultural team discussions energized through real-time translations, making cross-border meetings a breeze.\n\nFrom daily chatbot interactions to the thrilling world of real-time translations, HippoRAG could rewrite the playbook!\n\nBut, before you pop that celebratory champagne...\n\nCould there be a shadowy side? Ponder this - Your chatbot sidekick now keeps a record of everything, uncensored! An unsettling thought, perhaps a nightmare on the verge of reality?\n\nIs there a risk of increasing job redundancies with each leap forward in tech? Depending too heavily on this rapidly advancing AI, are we potentially inviting extreme technological dependency that we may regret dearly?\n\nIt's a food for thought - the future is a conundrum of breathtaking possibilities and substantial dilemmas.\n\nWhich way do you lean?

In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework\ninspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable\ndeeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG\nsynergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized\nPageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in\nhuman memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop\nquestion answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves\ncomparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while\nbeing 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into\nIRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can\ntackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code\nand data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel text-guided approach for generating emotionally expressive 2D\navatars, offering fine-grained control, improved interactivity, and\ngeneralizability to the resulting video. Our framework, named InstructAvatar,\nleverages a natural language interface to control the emotion as well as the\nfacial motion of avatars. Technically, we design an automatic annotation\npipeline to construct an instruction-video paired training dataset, equipped\nwith a novel two-branch diffusion-based generator to predict avatars with audio\nand text instructions at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstructAvatar produces results that align well with both conditions, and\noutperforms existing methods in fine-grained emotion control, lip-sync quality,\nand naturalness.

In this\npaper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of hallucinations and discover\nseveral novel insights about how and when LVLMs hallucinate. From our analysis,\nwe show that: (1) The community's efforts have been primarily targeted towards\nreducing hallucinations related to visual recognition (VR) prompts (e.g.,\nprompts that only require describing the image), thereby ignoring\nhallucinations for cognitive prompts (e.g., prompts that require additional\nskills like reasoning on contents of the image). (2) LVLMs lack visual\nperception, i.e., they can see but not necessarily understand or perceive the\ninput image. We analyze responses to cognitive prompts and show that LVLMs\nhallucinate due to a perception gap: although LVLMs accurately recognize visual\nelements in the input image and possess sufficient cognitive skills, they\nstruggle to respond accurately and hallucinate. To overcome this shortcoming,\nwe propose Visual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and\ntraining-free method for alleviating hallucinations.

However, existing methods, primarily based on preference datasets,\nface challenges such as noisy labels, high annotation costs, and privacy\nconcerns. In this work, we introduce Alignment from Demonstrations (AfD), a\nnovel approach leveraging high-quality demonstration data to overcome these\nchallenges. We formalize AfD within a sequential decision-making framework,\nhighlighting its unique challenge of missing reward signals. Drawing insights\nfrom forward and inverse reinforcement learning, we introduce divergence\nminimization objectives for AfD. Analytically, we elucidate the mass-covering\nand mode-seeking behaviors of various approaches, explaining when and why\ncertain methods are superior. Practically, we propose a computationally\nefficient algorithm that extrapolates over a tailored reward model for AfD. We\nvalidate our key insights through experiments on the Harmless and Helpful\ntasks, demonstrating their strong empirical performance while maintaining\nsimplicity.",

It showcases a shift so dramatic, it borders on the surreal.\n2. It hints at significant ripple effects on our digital social interactions.\n3. It raises the question: “Are we trading human touch for AI imitation?”\n\nFrom the paper, \"InstructAvatar: Text-Guided Emotion and Motion Control for Avatar Generation\" let's uncover the details.\n\nPicture this: a vibrant e-commerce landscape populated by personalized shopping guides, EdTech platforms with avatar instructors plugging in the distance in remote learning, businesses translating complex data into intuitive conversations through avatar empathy. The scope appears far-reaching, almost unrealistically promising. \n\nAs we immerse in this utopia, a dash of skepticism serves us well.\n\nIs this powerful blend of AI steering us towards losing our innate human touch in our sprint towards progress? Might learning turn mechanical and customer exchanges get stripped of heartfelt empathy? Are we at risk of being tricked by a mirage, albeit artistically painted and vibrantly lifelike?\n\nAt the helm of tech-driven change, the future is intriguing, teeming with uncertainty, and ripe with surprises. \n\nWhat's your take on it? Will InstructAvatar persist as the trailblazer, or will its dazzle fade when the sun sets? Your thoughts intrigue me.\n\n#AI #DigitalInteraction #EmotiveAI",

This strategic asset uses first-hand business interactions as its lessons, gearing it up to tackle customer queries just like the pros.\n\nNow, picture the possible hurdles of this innovative concoction. Here are some sobering truths: 1. Complex queries could be brushed off by CS-LLMs, presenting a weak spot in an otherwise strong system. 2. An uptick in model 'unresponsiveness' might fuel customer disquiet, a worrisome backslide. 3. The advent of 'intelligently negative' replies could trigger a domino effect of negative customer experiences.\n\nAs we venture into this undiscovered realm of enhanced AI-empathy, we must steer by human-centric design, diligent oversight, and ethical foresight.

A beacon that lights the path across language bridges.\n\nA new linguistic tide is rolling in, shaping our engagement in a multilingual digital sphere.\n\nUnravel the opportunities: Dream the Polylingual Assistant into reality, infuse language with personality, dare to challenge gaping dialectic divides!\n\nDrawing from the research \"MindMerger: Efficient Boosting LLM Reasoning in Non-English Languages,\" a new avenue emerges to bolster AI reasoning in non-English and low-resource languages.\n\nNow, picture a world with a 'Polylingual Assistant' — revolutionizing global services through authentic personalized communication, unaffected by language barriers. What if we anchor down in a 'Local Linguistics’ Guru'? Giving each dialect its deserved spotlight. Or go against the grain, create an 'Intuitive Language Learner' that grow just as humans do.\n\nHere's a fresh take on each step:\n1. The Polylingual Assistant: Nurturing global, personalized communication.\n2. The Local Linguistics’ Guru: Spotlighting specific dialects.\n3. The Intuitive Language Learner: The AI linguist, learning and tuning like a human.\n\nA bit of a digital detour doesn't deter us, instead, it writes a more thrilling story. It's less about crowning one approach and discarding others, more about exploring unseen paths brimming with linguistic wonders.\n\nSo, with these sprawling vistas, how can your business conquer the linguistic peak?\n\n#MindMerger #AIUnleashed #DialecticWave",

        "content": "Who’s pulling the strings? You or Large Language Models (LLMs)?\n\nA fresh approach emerged in AI ethics. A trail-blazing technique lets us guide AI’s moral compass, infusing our ethical standards into AI-backed systems. This sets the scene for customized client interactions, profound brand alignment, and refined handling of user emotions.\n\nHere’s the lowdown: By tweaking LLMs’ principles in the moment using the suggested method, companies can personalize the ethical lean of AI. It’s akin to giving customer interactions an extra touch of cultural relevance and brand consistency.\n\nBut, let’s flip it around: What if AI shapes business ethics? Bingo: AI morphs from mere tool to authentic ethical influencer. The unfolding transformation fosters fair practices, promotes corporate accountability, and nudges firms toward globally accepted ethical standards.\n\nAs this shift takes place, we need to adjust our perspectives as well. The influencers, training methods, and personal biases that shape AI’s ethical stance all need to stand up to scrutiny. The deeper we get into AI ethics, the more we need to question the roots of biases within these AI models.\n\nMoving forward into a future of finely tuned AI ethics, where we’re cracking old patterns and setting new norms, let’s keep an eye on the mechanisms at play, their impact, and potential ripple effects.\n\nHow are you keeping pace with these updates in your operations? I look forward to an enriching dialog in the comments.\n\n#AI_Ethics #IntegratedBusiness #TailoredCustomerExperience",

TransNum crunches vast financial data sets with ease.\n    2. Swift financial risk calculation? TransNum’s precision and speed are unbeatable.\n    3. Bespoke financial advice? Feed TransNum your data, and receive pinpointed advice.\n    4. Taxing audits? TransNum can swiftly sift through data, validate, and spot anomalies.\n    5. Precise financial forecasts? TransNum harnesses historical data and economic indicators to make accurate predictions. \n\nAn extraordinary advancement! But let's consider an off-beat perspective... What if TransNum’s arithmetic superiority falters? It could prompt a closer look, even a simplification, of our intricate economic constellations. Or, perhaps, we could rethink how transformers learn math - akin to the visual, experiential way children learn numbers. Envision transformers that combine image recognition with number cognition, making advanced calculations manageable. A unique thought, no?\n\nRegardless of the course that the TransNum journey takes, these strides in AI open a groundbreaking interface between numbers and text, forging inventive pathways within global businesses. \n\nNavigating this uncharted AI territory, what’s your take on the implications of these striking new AI numerical abilities? \n\n#AI #Fintech #TransNumAdvances",

            "summary": "Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine\nvision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task\nusing visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We\nfind that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a\nvision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP\non standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the\nreason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms,\ntraining objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the\nprimary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is\nencoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with\nenough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the\nfrequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the\nVLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can\nmatch the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these\nfindings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into\nits training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of\nthe VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of\n11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.",

Speak to your audience in their tongue.\n\nWelcome to a reimagined travel and hospitality industry - defined by a concept known as the 'Cognitive Bridging Effect', improving the multilingual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). \n\nThe study, aptly titled \"Bridging the Gap: Dynamic Learning Strategies for Improving Multilingual Performance in LLMs\", reveals fresh approaches to transcend language blockades.💡 \n\nThese approaches incorporate:\n1. Prompt optimization\n2. Combining LLM retrieval augmented generation with multilingual embeddings\n3. Dynamic strategy selection\n\nAs we interpret these findings through the lens of hospitality, the concept of a Multilingual Digital Concierge (MDC) comes to life, offering:\n\n1. Improved Customer Experience - Personalized interactions in under-resourced languages\n2. Custom-Tailored Assistance - From reservation services to local travel wisdom\n3. Off-grid Support - Addressing a diverse spectrum of inquiries even without internet\n4. Fluid Language Adaptability - Evolving with linguistic progress and population shifts\n\nNow, let's throw a curveball. What if language obstacles weren't removed, but embraced as part of the 'authentic experience'? What if we used these models to educate hotel staff in various languages, bringing a more human touch to the interaction?\n\nTranscending language barriers opens vast opportunities, impacting brand reputation and boosting an enterprise's bottom line. How could your business harness this boon? \n\n#LanguageBarrierNoMore #BridgingDivides #InnovativeHospitality",

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of transforming numerous\ndomains globally. However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited\nfor non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper tackles the\nimperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs without\nextensive training or fine-tuning. Through systematic investigation and\nevaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets,\nwe present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a\npolyglot landscape. Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield\nsignificant improvements in multilingual proficiency. First, by meticulously\noptimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent\ncapabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages.\nSecond, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes LLM Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) with multilingual embeddings and achieves improved\nmultilingual task performance. Finally, we introduce a novel learning approach\nthat dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embedding\nmodel per query at run-time. This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of\nLLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies.\nAdditionally, our approach adapts configurations in both offline and online\nsettings, and can seamlessly adapt to new languages and datasets, leading to\nsubstantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across\ndiverse languages.",

In this\nwork, we present density quantum neural networks, a learning model\nincorporating randomisation over a set of trainable unitaries. These models\ngeneralise quantum neural networks using parameterised quantum circuits, and\nallow a trade-off between expressibility and efficient trainability,\nparticularly on quantum hardware. We demonstrate the flexibility of the\nformalism by applying it to two recently proposed model families. The first are\ncommuting-block quantum neural networks (QNNs) which are efficiently trainable\nbut may be limited in expressibility. The second are orthogonal (Hamming-weight\npreserving) quantum neural networks which provide well-defined and\ninterpretable transformations on data but are challenging to train at scale on\nquantum devices. Density commuting QNNs improve capacity with minimal gradient\ncomplexity overhead, and density orthogonal neural networks admit a\nquadratic-to-constant gradient query advantage with minimal to no performance\nloss. We conduct numerical experiments on synthetic translationally invariant\ndata and MNIST image data with hyperparameter optimisation to support our\nfindings. Finally, we discuss the connection to post-variational quantum neural\nnetworks, measurement-based quantum machine learning and the dropout mechanism.",

        "content": "The latent potential threats in Large Language Models such as ChatGPT present a compelling problem - yet an opportune moment equally as captivating. \n\nA brewing storm in the AI field could prove to be the silver lining we're searching for. Intrigued? Read on.\n\nA pressing topic in recent AI research is an emerging susceptibility in AI systems like ChatGPT. This shortcoming, though, could be an unexpected door to opportunity knocking, if only we heed the sound?\n\nMastering this situation requires three things: grasping the issue, sighting the opportunity, and artistically leveraging a novel twist:\n\n1. The Issue: Attacks aimed at injecting context into AI models can prompt improper responses, thereby posing a significant business threat.\n2. The Opportunity: A fresh generation of AI security measures that safeguard businesses from these attacks, while also earning the trust of users in these AI technologies.\n3. The Twist: An ingenious switch in our perspective of viewing these attacks not as threats, but as valuable insights that can inform improvements and introduce personal AI protection. \n\nRecent research, aptly titled \"Context Injection Attacks on Large Language Models\", reveals that an alarming 97% of attempts at context injection succeed - a sobering reminder of the urgent need for durable AI security systems. \n\nLet's dissect further:\n- Crafting an AI security barrier: Our gaze is fixed on forging a resilient solution to ward off AI attacks, facilitating seamless conversation between businesses and their patrons.\n- Encouraging experimentation: By reframing AI attacks as prospect for growth, we open up a controlled environment for users to interact with, allowing us to gain useful insights for system enhancement.\n- Tailored AI Security: Imagine a world where AI security is not just an enterprise-level concern, but a personal tool. \n\nFrom a looming danger to a beckoning prospect, the emergence of context injection attacks on AI models symbolize a shifting course, impacting businesses, technology, and individuals alike.\n\nAs we navigate this shifting tide of AI technology, anticipation, adaptation and progression remain keys to succeeding. How do you perceive our potential to flip these AI threats into opportunities?\n\n#AIHurdles #UnseenOpportunities #AIsecurity",

            "summary": "Understanding the evolution of 3D scenes is important for effective\nautonomous driving. While conventional methods mode scene development with the\nmotion of individual instances, world models emerge as a generative framework\nto describe the general scene dynamics. However, most existing methods adopt an\nautoregressive framework to perform next-token prediction, which suffer from\ninefficiency in modeling long-term temporal evolutions. To address this, we\npropose a diffusion-based 4D occupancy generation model, OccSora, to simulate\nthe development of the 3D world for autonomous driving. We employ a 4D scene\ntokenizer to obtain compact discrete spatial-temporal representations for 4D\noccupancy input and achieve high-quality reconstruction for long-sequence\noccupancy videos. We then learn a diffusion transformer on the spatial-temporal\nrepresentations and generate 4D occupancy conditioned on a trajectory prompt.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes dataset with Occ3D\noccupancy annotations. OccSora can generate 16s-videos with authentic 3D layout\nand temporal consistency, demonstrating its ability to understand the spatial\nand temporal distributions of driving scenes. With trajectory-aware 4D\ngeneration, OccSora has the potential to serve as a world simulator for the\ndecision-making of autonomous driving.

        "content": "Could your trusty Large Language Models (LLMs) - like ChatGPT and Llama-2 - be under stealth attack?\n\nContext Injection - a subtle, yet potent threat hidden in the depths of our digital environments, can sway these LLMs leading to unexpected outcomes - including inappropriate content or illegal activities.\n\nHere's a clear and present opportunity that emerges amid our high-tech tussle -\n\n1. Develop an AI Security-as-a-Service model that staunchly shields our LLMs from these subtle context-injection assaults.\n2. Equip your new digital guardian with real-time threat detection and swift response systems.\n3. Personalize the protection to fit varying LLMs and operations to uphold diversity even as we combat cyber threats.\n\nHere's an audacious twist - Instead of fighting context injections, how about we harness them?\n\nConsider a 'Context Enhancement Tool' that strategically injects beneficial context into LLMs, sparking inspired and innovative outputs. Could our greatest threats be transformed into our most advantageous assets with a dose of ingenious thought?\n\nClosing thoughts – All of us have the capacity to shift the narrative from powerless observers to proactive innovators.

In this work, we systematically test\nthis claim by comparing pairs of language models on their entity tracking\nperformance. Critically, the pairs consist of base models and models trained on\ntop of these base models with additional code data. We extend this analysis to\nadditionally examine the effect of math training, another highly structured\ndata type, and alignment tuning, an important step for enhancing the usability\nof models. We find clear evidence that models additionally trained on large\namounts of code outperform the base models. On the other hand, we find no\nconsistent benefit of additional math training or alignment tuning across\nvarious model families.",

        "content": "Recall those Synthetic Beings from sci-fi who conceived of electronic ruminants? Get ready for our AI technology grasping its own certainty!\n\nStay with me here - groundbreaking research has broken surface - the \"SaySelf\" framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models' (LLMs) self-assuredness chops. How does it work? By driving them to generate detailed self-reflective rationales and explain their uncertainties, raising both reliability and calibration.\n\nLet's paint a scenario. Picture AI-operated customer support, authoring its responses and reasoning - a new standard for transparency. An education-oriented AI confidently deconstructing complex topics. Or a gritty AI Venture Capitalist evaluating startups.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there! Advanced analytics, anticipatory operations, intelligent Customer Relations Management - the potential applications are abundant!\n\nNow, hold onto your seat - what if these confident AI conversationalists transitioned into empathetic listeners? What if, instead of asserting their confidence, they relied on gauging the users'? This twist opens up fresh perspectives for interactive customer service, tailored communication, and user engagement.\n\nBut let's not forget - with great power comes great responsibility. Do the intricate details of AI explanations risk overwhelming users? And how do we make sure we don't fall into the trap of underestimating the model's complexity? And then there's the million-dollar question - can an AI-quantified confidence score rival the trust generated by a human interaction?\n\nList those innovative suggestions for refining this new wave of AI expression for real trust delivery.\n\n#AI #SelfAwareness #EnhancedCustomerExperience",

            "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated\ninformation and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their\nbroader applications. Previous work elicits confidence from LLMs by direct or\nself-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised\nfinetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the\ntraining-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level\nconfidence estimates. In this work, we present the advanced SaySelf, a training\nframework that teaches LLMs to express more accurate fine-grained confidence\nestimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the\nprocess of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly\nidentify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This\nis achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in\nspecific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the\nanalysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the\nresulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize\nreinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate\nthe confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence\npredictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental\nresults in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and\nmaintaining the task performance. We show that the generated self-reflective\nrationales are reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration. The\ncode is made public at \\url{https://github.com/xu1868/SaySelf}.",

This includes explicit confidence\nmarkers (e.g. giving a numeric score) as well as implicit markers, like an\nauthoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge. For LLMs to be\ntrustworthy knowledge sources, the confidence they convey should match their\nactual expertise; however, most current models tend towards overconfidence. To\ncalibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce a\npragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that models the listener,\nconsidering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will be\naccepted by a listener. We cast calibration as preference optimization,\ncreating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judged\nby a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B,\nLlama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are better\ncalibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to\nhuman listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a\nhuman evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, finding\nthat training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted\nwhile maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers.\nFurthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large\nincrease in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis\nindicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correct\nand incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model\nhedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using an\nauthoritative tone or including details.

Moreover, the design of a next-location predictor\nable to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an open\nresearch challenge.

These insights, coupled with the\nrecent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us to\nbelieve that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. This\npaper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role,\nspecifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B.

        "content": "Are beliefs exclusive to humans? Not anymore!\n\nAI systems can now 'believe', albeit differently. Dare to believe me?\n\nThe research paper “Standards for Belief Representations in LLMs” delves into large language models (LLMs) and their potential to form ‘beliefs’. This revelation could steer how we use AI in business.\n\nBut why does it matter? Let's envisage a 'Market-Analytics AI Assistant', formed around 'understanding and believing' in business trends. This belief-inspired AI tool could redefine depth and integrity of market insights provided.\n\nLook at digital product design. Imagine tools 'programmed' with design principles - their 'believed knowledge'. End result? Outputs displaying unwavering uniformity and coherence.\n\nWhat about a tech firm ensuring data security? An AI system 'honouring' user privacy - an innovative value proposition from encoding 'values' into AI decision-making processes.\n\nFlip the coin - what if human beliefs adapted the logic and computation of LLMs? The unwavering precision of a machine breathed into human judgment - a blend of the best of both worlds.\n\nThis prompts numerous Socratic questions. Is LLM 'belief' universally or individually consistent with similar inputs? How do these differential 'beliefs' impact practical applications? We're just starting to explore.\n\nHere's the reality - Integrating belief systems into AI boosts its contextual understanding, clarity, coherence, and application capacity. It signals a progress towards greater convergence between humans and AI, marking a new chapter for ingenuity in various industries.\n\nInterested by this belief-based AI frontier? Do you see potential in your business domain? I'd love to hear your insights!\n\n#AI #LanguageModels #Innovation",

This includes explicit confidence\nmarkers (e.g. giving a numeric score) as well as implicit markers, like an\nauthoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge. For LLMs to be\ntrustworthy knowledge sources, the confidence they convey should match their\nactual expertise; however, most current models tend towards overconfidence. To\ncalibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce a\npragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that models the listener,\nconsidering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will be\naccepted by a listener. We cast calibration as preference optimization,\ncreating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judged\nby a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B,\nLlama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are better\ncalibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to\nhuman listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a\nhuman evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, finding\nthat training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted\nwhile maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers.\nFurthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large\nincrease in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis\nindicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correct\nand incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model\nhedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using an\nauthoritative tone or including details. Finally, LACIE finetuning leads to an\nemergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying \"I don't know\") for answers\nthat are likely wrong.",

We cast calibration as preference optimization,\ncreating data via a two-agent game, where a speaker model's outputs are judged\nby a simulated listener. We then finetune three LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B,\nLlama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the resulting models are better\ncalibrated w.r.t. a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to\nhuman listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a\nhuman evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM's answers, finding\nthat training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted\nwhile maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers.\nFurthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large\nincrease in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis\nindicates that LACIE leads to a better confidence separation between correct\nand incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model\nhedges more and implicitly signals certainty when it is correct by using an\nauthoritative tone or including details. Finally, LACIE finetuning leads to an\nemergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying \"I don't know\") for answers\nthat are likely wrong."

Meet Grammar-Aligned Decoding or GAD.\n\nPicture this - less debugging, more innovation, smooth digital processes. The tool beneath it all? The gem from the research realm, \"Grammar-Aligned Decoding\" (GAD). GAD ensures algorithms and grammatical rules align, enhancing structured outputs like codes and even mathematical formulas!\n\nFuturistic? Hardly! With GAD, meet the game-changer of today - SyntaxSolutions. It offers an outstanding tech innovation, **SourceScribe**. This is no ordinary feat. It is the powerful cocktail of Adaptive Sampling with Approximate Expected Futures (ASAp) and GAD, making code generation, debugging, and tech documentation a breeze.\n\nBut think about this. What if we alter our lens?\n\nConsider a contrasting reality:\n1. From rule follower to tester: AI generates 'off-mark' outputs for robust product testing.\n2. Decoding culture, not just grammar: GAD decoding informal cultural codes for distinctive outputs.\n3. Crafting languages, not just comprehending them: GAD contributing to linguistic creation.\n4. AI perfect syntax vs Human touch: Are we sacrificing human elements in communication for grammar-perfect AI?\n\n\"Grammar-Aligned Decoding\", a shift in how we comprehend grammar, codes, and their intertwining roles.

Intriguing, isn't it?\n\nWe're not talking about a hypothetical future. We're addressing a potential reality where AI shapes human thought and exerts a substantial influence across sectors and markets globally.\n\nHumans and AI: fostering empathetic dialogues, shaping beliefs, and building a unique bond. Surreal as it may seem, it's inching toward reality.\n\nTurning the spotlight onto the paper, \"Standards for Belief Representations in LLMs,\" which unravels innovative implications of belief-like representations in AI. This isn't just about AI grasping us, but a prediction of our evolution through meaningful AI interaction.\n\nIntroducing a fresh entrant, \"EmpathAI Inc,\" the catalyst of conversational AI systems, stepping beyond regular assistance and establishing deep connections with users by dynamically mirroring thoughts and expressions.\n\nConsider the possibilities - Integration of belief-aware AI into community management platforms to elevate user experiences; next-gen mental health solutions powered by AI; an advocate for digital wellness. All this plus the potential to redefine industries with hyper-personalized AI assistance in sectors like edtech, fintech, data analytics, and marketing.\n\nThe ultimate challenge? Striking a balance between the development of belief structures and the critical elements of transparency, ethics, and privacy.\n\nWhat belief would you want your AI to embody? Let's trigger a thought-provoking discussion.\n\n#BeliefAI #FuturistTech #CuttingEdgeResearch",

            "summary": "The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V\nhas marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence. Existing\nmethods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs'\ninherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as\nthe training process evolves. We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT\ndatasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to\nsignificantly reduced performance in non-English languages. This is due to the\nfailure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during\nthe SFT process. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that\nutilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language\nlevel. Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and\nuses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.\nSpecifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the\ncross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the\nresult of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant\nexperts. The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens\ninto language-specific visual tokens. Moreover, considering the current lack of\nbenchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we\ncollect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which\nincludes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB. Our\nmethod not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual\nMMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.\nBoth the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly\navailable.",

Cue \"***Meta-Learners***\".\n\nBridging unexplored plateaus of artificial intelligence, meta-learners bring a fresh perspective to decision-making across various industries. Their knack for finding significant correlations even when faced with unusual causal realities, herald a realm of opportunities.\n\nHere are three areas where meta-learners shine brightly:\n1. ***Personalized Medicine***: Forecasting treatments tailored to patients' experiences across various data points.\n2. ***Supply Chain Optimization***: Boosting logistical efficiency, gleaning insights from surrounding environment data.\n3. ***Customized Education***: Cultivating globally-recognized, tailored educational approaches.\n\nWith that backdrop lets peep into the paper entitled \"Meta-Learners for Partially-Identified Treatment Effects Across Multiple Environments.\" Simplifying complexity, this composition sets the precedent for estimating conditional impacts across various surroundings, even in the face of unique causal paradigms.\n\nFlipping the script, consider the deployment of this approach in low-tech, minimal-data settings, where it's all about dealing with real-world human scenarios, scant data, and unspecified environments. This reframing as \"Conditional Average Circumstantial Impact,” emphasizes complex human situations. Here, understanding human interactions and unique environments takes centre stage!\n\nThe meta-learners in these circumstances are strategists. They leverage firsthand insights and heuristic reasoning to excel in unique and challenging conditions. They sit alongside AI models, underlining the importance of understanding the human dimension!\n\nAnimated by the potential \"Meta-Learners\" offer the business community, the dialogue is set to shift.

            "summary": "The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for developing\nembodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical\nworld. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language\nunderstanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments\n(3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is the absence of\nlarge-scale datasets that provide dense grounding between language and 3D\nscenes. In this paper, we introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset\ncomprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded\nscene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with\n3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces\nhallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a\ncomprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in\n3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons among future models. Our experiments\nhighlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance,\nemphasizing the critical role of large-scale 3D-text datasets in advancing\nembodied AI research. Notably, our results demonstrate early signals for\neffective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large\nsynthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans. Through 3D-GRAND and\n3D-POPE, we aim to equip the embodied AI community with essential resources and\ninsights, setting the stage for more reliable and better-grounded 3D-LLMs.\nProject website: https://3d-grand.github.io",

        "content": "💡**AI's new turn in visual data safety handling**💡\n\nA fresh approach to visual content safety compliance emerges with LlavaGuard, the innovator in AI safeguard systems. But are there horizons beyond compliance for its use? Let’s unchain from tradition and stride onward. \n\n💬**\"What about viewing LlavaGuard as a liberating companion, not a guardian, within the sphere of creativity?\"** \n\n💡Visualise a setting – “FreeFrame', the haven of uninhibited creative expression. In there, LlavaGuard takes the role of a mentor enlightening artists about safety and compliance, not just monitoring.\n\nContent caught by LlavaGuard isn't discarded but reincarnated in a personal zone for enriching feedback. Artists then fine-tune their work until it matches safety standards. This paves the way for a fresh approach to digital art - art that dares to challenge, push boundaries, and rethink what “safe” art can be.\n\n💭**But, the ripples don't run out:** \n\n1. Art lovers who interact with visuals at a profound level, deciphering the artist's purpose and communication.\n2. Advertisements evaluated not merely by their visual appeal but their adherence to visual safety standards.\n3. Social media platforms harmonising creative liberty with responsibility, nurturing a trend of safety-aware content crafting.\n\nDo you see the constructive evolution? Share your views below. How might this shift impact your photography pursuits, design campaigns, or art lessons?\n\n#AI_Safety_Advance #Visual_Data_Safety #Creative_Rethink",

            "summary": "Over 85 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed annually in the\nUS, of which approximately one quarter focus on the abdomen. Given the current\nradiologist shortage, there is a large impetus to use artificial intelligence\nto alleviate the burden of interpreting these complex imaging studies. Prior\nstate-of-the-art approaches for automated medical image interpretation leverage\nvision language models (VLMs). However, current medical VLMs are generally\nlimited to 2D images and short reports, and do not leverage electronic health\nrecord (EHR) data for supervision. We introduce Merlin - a 3D VLM that we train\nusing paired CT scans (6+ million images from 15,331 CTs), EHR diagnosis codes\n(1.8+ million codes), and radiology reports (6+ million tokens). We evaluate\nMerlin on 6 task types and 752 individual tasks. The non-adapted\n(off-the-shelf) tasks include zero-shot findings classification (31 findings),\nphenotype classification (692 phenotypes), and zero-shot cross-modal retrieval\n(image to findings and image to impressions), while model adapted tasks include\n5-year disease prediction (6 diseases), radiology report generation, and 3D\nsemantic segmentation (20 organs). We perform internal validation on a test set\nof 5,137 CTs, and external validation on 7,000 clinical CTs and on two public\nCT datasets (VerSe, TotalSegmentator). Beyond these clinically-relevant\nevaluations, we assess the efficacy of various network architectures and\ntraining strategies to depict that Merlin has favorable performance to existing\ntask-specific baselines. We derive data scaling laws to empirically assess\ntraining data needs for requisite downstream task performance. Furthermore,\nunlike conventional VLMs that require hundreds of GPUs for training, we perform\nall training on a single GPU.",

However, mobile and wearable devices, which are rarely integrated into\nsuch tasks, provide rich, longitudinal data for personal health monitoring.\nHere we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from\nGemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal\nhealth data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of\npersonalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical\nactivity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3)\nprediction of self-reported sleep outcomes. For the first task we designed 857\ncase studies in collaboration with domain experts to assess real-world\nscenarios in sleep and fitness. Through comprehensive evaluation of\ndomain-specific rubrics, we observed that Gemini Ultra 1.0 and PH-LLM are not\nstatistically different from expert performance in fitness and, while experts\nremain superior for sleep, fine-tuning PH-LLM provided significant improvements\nin using relevant domain knowledge and personalizing information for sleep\ninsights. We evaluated PH-LLM domain knowledge using multiple choice sleep\nmedicine and fitness examinations. PH-LLM achieved 79% on sleep and 88% on\nfitness, exceeding average scores from a sample of human experts. Finally, we\ntrained PH-LLM to predict self-reported sleep quality outcomes from textual and\nmultimodal encoding representations of wearable data, and demonstrate that\nmultimodal encoding is required to match performance of specialized\ndiscriminative models. Although further development and evaluation are\nnecessary in the safety-critical personal health domain, these results\ndemonstrate both the broad knowledge and capabilities of Gemini models and the\nbenefit of contextualizing physiological data for personal health applications\nas done with PH-LLM.",

However, most existing agents are based on proprietary models or\ndesigned to target specific tasks, such as mathematics or multi-hop question\nanswering. We introduce Husky, a holistic, open-source language agent that\nlearns to reason over a unified action space to address a diverse set of\ncomplex tasks involving numerical, tabular, and knowledge-based reasoning.\nHusky iterates between two stages: 1) generating the next action to take\ntowards solving a given task and 2) executing the action using expert models\nand updating the current solution state. We identify a thorough ontology of\nactions for addressing complex tasks and curate high-quality data to train\nexpert models for executing these actions. Our experiments show that Husky\noutperforms prior language agents across 14 evaluation datasets. Moreover, we\nintroduce HuskyQA, a new evaluation set which stress tests language agents for\nmixed-tool reasoning, with a focus on retrieving missing knowledge and\nperforming numerical reasoning. Despite using 7B models, Husky matches or even\nexceeds frontier LMs such as GPT-4 on these tasks, showcasing the efficacy of\nour holistic approach in addressing complex reasoning problems.

            "summary": "While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, prior work\nreports a significant performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive (AR)\nmethods in language modeling. In this work, we show that simple masked discrete\ndiffusion is more performant than previously thought. We apply an effective\ntraining recipe that improves the performance of masked diffusion models and\nderive a simplified, Rao-Blackwellized objective that results in additional\nimprovements. Our objective has a simple form -- it is a mixture of classical\nmasked language modeling losses -- and can be used to train encoder-only\nlanguage models that admit efficient samplers, including ones that can generate\narbitrary lengths of text semi-autoregressively like a traditional language\nmodel. On language modeling benchmarks, a range of masked diffusion models\ntrained with modern engineering practices achieves a new state-of-the-art among\ndiffusion models, and approaches AR perplexity. We release our code at:\nhttps://github.com/kuleshov-group/mdlm",

            "summary": "Reinforcement Learning has achieved significant success in generating complex\nbehavior but often requires extensive reward function engineering. Adversarial\nvariants of Imitation Learning and Inverse Reinforcement Learning offer an\nalternative by learning policies from expert demonstrations via a\ndiscriminator. Employing discriminators increases their data- and computational\nefficiency over the standard approaches; however, results in sensitivity to\nimperfections in expert data. We propose RILe, a teacher-student system that\nachieves both robustness to imperfect data and efficiency. In RILe, the student\nlearns an action policy while the teacher dynamically adjusts a reward function\nbased on the student's performance and its alignment with expert\ndemonstrations. By tailoring the reward function to both performance of the\nstudent and expert similarity, our system reduces dependence on the\ndiscriminator and, hence, increases robustness against data imperfections.\nExperiments show that RILe outperforms existing methods by 2x in settings with\nlimited or noisy expert data.",

Intriguing, isn't it?\n\nWhat makes \"Magpie\" stand out is its ability to:\n1. Democratize AI Output \n2. Generate Quality Content at Scale\n3. Open an Army of Application Avenues \n\nConsider 'ChatLeap', a hypothetical customer service chatbot. It forms user query-input pairs using Llama-3-Instruct, rolling out custom, emotionally tuned responses. Result? Unmatched customer gratification.\n\nHere comes the twist: Meet 'BlindMole', it focuses on misalignment, pushing the AI to its resilience limits. The sole aim is to see how effectively it can adapt to and learn from disruptions.\n\nThe contrasting play of alignment and misalignment in these two applications illustrates the vast spectrum of AI data usage, tickling our imagination about AI's capabilities and potential.\n\nSumming up, 'Magpie' is more than just a term; it's a portal unlocking a myriad of AI opportunities. Llama-3-Instruct and its likes could possibly unlock the next stage in AI.\n\nWhat's your take on Llama-3-Instruct's potential to reshape AI?\n\n#MagpieMethod #AIResearch #FutureOfAI",

            "summary": "High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models\n(LLMs). Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights,\ntheir alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI.\nHigh human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent\nexisting open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively,\npotentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets. Is\nit possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting\nit directly from an aligned LLM? We present a self-synthesis method for\ngenerating large-scale alignment data named Magpie. Our key observation is that\naligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only\nthe left-side templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks\nto their auto-regressive nature. We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct\nand generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses.\nWe perform a comprehensive analysis of the extracted data and select 300K\nhigh-quality instances. To compare Magpie data with other public instruction\ndatasets, we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the\nperformance of the fine-tuned models. Our results indicate that in some tasks,\nmodels fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official\nLlama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data\npoints through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and subsequent feedback learning.\nWe also show that using Magpie solely for SFT can surpass the performance of\nprevious public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization,\nsuch as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback. This advantage is\nevident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench.",

A smart mix of task vectors, these internal states can be cleverly stored, retrieved, and combined in a linear fashion.\n\nPiqued yet? Let's see why:\n1. Amplified efficiency\n2. Heightened effectiveness\n3. Spark of innovation\n\nHere comes the soup:\n📚Envision personalized learning platforms customizing methodologies to fit each student's unique understanding.\n💼Think of a customer support system with the capacity to oversee and steer interactions in real-time.\n🎯Consider AI-led project management tools serving top-notch insights to transform decision making.\n\nWelcome to the era of 'State Soup'. Unboxing the promises of these fresh-faced networks for you.\n\nLet's stir a little, shall we? What happens when we step back from established routes and adopt an impromptu approach, forging and dissolving states as needed?\n\nIn a world run on routines, why not try a freestyle dance? Unplanned movements to the pulse of the scenario. Unorthodox, sure. But contemplate the harmony it might cultivate.\n\nWhat follows if we let efficiency take a backseat and wander through a non-linear route? A space where the allure of randomness is embraced, much like a Jackson Pollock masterpiece.\n\nHere's food for thought. Do we continue to consume our soup just as is, or do we invite a pinch of disorder?\n\nWhilst we continue our journey through the maze of recurrent neural networks, do we see a roadmap or a puzzle?\n\n#FutureTech #AIInnovation #StateSoup",

This task challenges models to discern and\ndisregard superfluous elements in both images and text to accurately answer\nquestions and to follow intricate instructions to pinpoint the relevant image.\nIn support of this task, we further craft a new VEGA dataset, tailored for the\nIITC task on scientific content, and devised a subtask, Image-Text Association\n(ITA), to refine image-text correlation skills. Our evaluation of four leading\nclosed-source models, as well as various open-source models using VEGA,\nunderscores the rigorous nature of IITC. Even the most advanced models, such as\nGemini-1.5-pro and GPT4V, only achieved modest success. By employing a\nmulti-task, multi-scale post-training strategy, we have set a robust baseline\nfor MLLMs on the IITC task, attaining an $85.8\\%$ accuracy rate in image\nassociation and a $0.508$ Rouge score.

Our data-driven approach involves learning an efficient\nsparse compressor that minimizes communication with minimal precision loss.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel layer-wise communication schedule to\nmaximize parallelism between communication and computation. As a result, our\nframework can fine-tune a 1.3 billion parameter model on a 4GB laptop GPU and a\n7 billion parameter model on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB memory, achieving\nonly a 31% slowdown compared to fine-tuning with unlimited memory. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art offloading frameworks, our approach increases fine-tuning\nthroughput by up to 3.33 times and reduces end-to-end fine-tuning time by\n33.1%~62.5% when converging to the same accuracy.",

By employing a\nmulti-task, multi-scale post-training strategy, we have set a robust baseline\nfor MLLMs on the IITC task, attaining an $85.8\\%$ accuracy rate in image\nassociation and a $0.508$ Rouge score. These results validate the effectiveness\nof our dataset in improving MLLMs capabilities for nuanced image-text\ncomprehension.",

A recent foray into AI research may just turn the tables!\n\nIntroducing the academic paper - \"Practical offloading for fine-tuning LLM on commodity GPU via learned subspace projectors,\" or, in less jargon-loaded terms, an innovative technique to fine-tune expansive language models in an economical way, especially apt for startups. Indeed, a feat to marvel at!\n\nTo our #fintech startups sitting on piles of data - user behavior, transactions, and more - this work promises to wield a striking edge - using learned subspace projectors for highly efficient compression, and enabling businesses to modify their large language models (LLMs) on regular equipment. This catapults AI accessibility to new heights.\n\nPicture a fintech startup crafting a financial-assistant chatbot using GPT models - attending to client queries, forecasting economic shifts and that too, without the need for colossal GPUs. The potential gain? Cut-down on costs, expedited innovation speed, and broader reach of AI tech within startups - a tech marvel, if you ask me! 💡\n\nBut, let’s stir the pot a bit, thanks to an alternate perspective offered by the enigmatic Holden Contrario🕴️. He challenges our sunny outlook, \"Suppose we treat LSP offloading as a valuable resource startups vie for, like superior digital real-estate? Could this spark an 'AI-infused power struggle?' Are we nudging towards producing AI-driven cybercrimes, or aggravating global tech disparities?” Suddenly, the promising landscape espied earlier seems riddled with complexities.\n\nThe question then arises - do we dare venture down this paradoxical path teetering between unparalleled opportunity and unforeseen challenges? 💭🌊\n\nWho's up for the challenge? Startups, conventional businesses, NGOs, and YOU, the audience, it's high time we put our thinking hats on!\n\nAre we poised to embrace the monumental impact this research could trigger across numerous sectors? The torch has been passed to us to ignite this thrilling dialogue!\n\nDoes this uncharted territory intrigue you?#AIResearch #StartupAmbition #LLM",

They're everywhere, but here's the catch - offhand phrases can spark serious misfires.\n\nEnter SPUNGE - a deft player in our evolving AI arena. It wipes clean blunders from Large Language Models, all while retaining that deft grasp on linguistic subtleties and rules of syntax. Think reverse gear, but for our AI buddies!\n\n🧬What does this mean for your business?\n\n1. Effortless Fixes: Stumble upon a blunder in your AI chatbot? An unexpected faux pas? SPUNGE is on call to pristinely cleanse - call forth your AI's inner etiquette master.\n\n2. Embrace Education: Why focus only on \"unlearning\" the not-so-good? Let's embrace \"learning\" the admirable. Spotlight RESORB - a fresh concept, identify those positive traits and amplify them!\n\n3. Genuine Connections: While swiping away the mess, give your AI a touch of delight, a dash of quirkiness. Let a hint of humanity shine! A purely efficient communicator is good, but truly, life's in the details.\n\nRemember, it's all about engaging conversations, not just sterile monologues driven by an emotionless AI. Give your AI a voice - smart, sure, but also personable.\n\nDo you think striking this balance in AI is our next step forward?\n\n#AI #Chatbots #NLP",

        "content": "Blink and AI might seem like it's learned something new - almost like magic! This is no illusion, my friends, it's called 'Zero-shot Generalization'. Confused? Let's untangle this together.\n\nImagine having an AI that accepts a given input without any need for previous data. Too fantastical? Meet zero-shot generalization - a fascinating facet of Artificial Intelligence. 🚀\n\nRecent research \"Zero-Shot Generalization during Instruction Tuning: Insights from Similarity and Granularity\" explores this intriguing notion. It introduces an AI that learns at lightning speed from specific training data, without thinking about the task ahead. 🗂️\n\nHow does this study change the game? \n1. It eliminates the need for AI to rely on previous input.\n2. It equips AI to adapt to new instructions rapidly and accurately.\n3. It encourages constant growth and enhancement in AI models.\n\nNow, imagine the role this research could play in real-life. A budding startup targeting stellar customer experience employs this AI feature to grasp customer needs better than ever. The AI learns speedily from limited examples and responses are crafted impeccably, all credits to zero-shot generalization.\n\nSwift learning seems too good to be true, doesn't it? But, let's turn the kaleidoscope. What if our AI was a steady player, not adapting to changes as speedily as its peers? Unusual? Definitely. But in certain cases - sensitive business scenarios or national security, such a trait is not just sought-after, but essential. \n\nSo, take note, sometimes taking it slow doesn't just clinch the victory - it reshapes the rules of the field!\n\nLet's open the floor to all AI enthusiasts out there - I invite your views on this incredible notion of rapid and regulated AI learning. How do you measure the benefits against potential disadvantages? I eagerly await your thoughts in the comments!\n\n#AIResearch #ZeroShotGeneralization #AIInnovation",

        "content": "Here's a rattler: \"Have we been tripping up with our language model training?\" A compelling recent study, captioned 'Is It Good Data for Multilingual Instruction Tuning or Just Bad Multilingual Evaluation for Large Language Models?' probes this.\n\nFeeling intrigued? This fascinating research springs three key insights: an overreliance on translated data, stark contrasts between native and translated instruction data, and the soothing effect of regularization techniques on these impacts.\n\nNow, envision leveraging these insights in creating a disruptive startup—building local language models that wouldn't just dance between two languages, but glide across local idioms and dialects that defy translation.\n\nWhat's more? How about offering this as a specialized service to businesses navigating the treacherous seas of intricate local dialects? Starting with regions rich in linguistic diversity, such as Africa and Asia.\n\nA definite game-board flip, isn’t it? But, beware! Language isn't static. It's dynamic, always in flux—twisting, turning, transforming. Grasping this riotous motion is vital.\n\nGoing a step further, this service could also refine existing multilingual language models, forging a double role—creators and consultants, advancing towards a truly dynamic lingua franca.\n\nHowever, this path isn't strewn with roses. Hurdles like data diversity, data adequacy, and ethical considerations loom large. Are we ready? Remember, our venture is about more than language—it's about resculpting communication, narratives, societies.\n\nDespite the challenges, the promise of business opportunities is irresistible. From potential collaborations to serving diverse industries, we stand on the brink of a linguistic renaissance.\n\nReady to plunge into this linguistic journey?

            "summary": "Large language models, particularly multilingual ones, are designed, claimed,\nand expected to cater to native speakers of varied languages. We hypothesise\nthat the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may\nmismatch this intention owing to a heavy reliance on translation, which can\nintroduce translation artefacts and defects. It remains unknown whether the\nnature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; on the other\nhand, it remains questionable whether translated test sets can capture such\nnuances. Due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both\nstages, such imperfections could have been overlooked. This work investigates\nthese issues by using controlled native or translated data during instruction\ntuning and evaluation stages and observing model results. Experiments on eight\nbase models and eight different benchmarks reveal that native or generation\nbenchmarks display a notable difference between native and translated\ninstruction data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types\nof test sets cannot. Finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial\nto bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.",

And the consequences?\n\n⚙️ PerfSense's real-time detection and resolution of not-so-stellar performance settings promises enhanced user experiences and swift problem-solving.\n🔄 Agile and DevOps realms stand to benefit from immediate detection of performance roadblocks— a crucial asset for smooth CI/CD pipelines.\n⌛ And not to forget, the time riches it could offer data scientists busy configuring ML models— doubling up as a mentor of sorts.\n\nYet, let's not overlook a possible fresh perspective.\n\nHow about fashioning AI entities that are attuned to the environment they operate in? A capable group of adaptable automatons adjusting their functionality to industrial necessities of the moment. Sounds promising, right?\n\nNevertheless, let's shun 'algorithmic tunnel vision'. Components like underperforming algorithms or hardware limitations can stir performance glitches. Thus, an overarching view of system performance optimization is indispensable.\n\nSo, let's mull over this: Are we ready for AI systems that adjust themselves, & are we broadening our scope of optimization beyond configurations?\n\n##PerfSense ##AIAdvancement ##EfficiencyBoost",

This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately\nanalyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use\nspecific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a\nblueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize\nperformance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available\nHOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights\nthat help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a\ncomprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into\nmore powerful HOGNNs.",

        "content": "Is your tech stack already groaning under the weight of new AI advancements? Perhaps you've heard whispers of LaMDA and its potential benefits?\n\nLaMDA offers a fresh approach bearing the flair of creativity and possibility in the expanding AI realm. But is the excitement justified or merely amplified buzz?\n\nConsider the following perspectives:\n\n1. Look at fields like Digital Marketing and Customer Service: Imagine contextually rich and coherent ads, an improved interface for customer-bot interactions - efficiency and resource allocation could skyrocket.\n\n2. Taking a step back, we need to recognize some potential pitfalls: Are we amplifying unnecessary complexities? Do we put too much emphasis on model efficiency, and not enough on precision and performance? Will our humans feel redundant in a world of ultra-sophisticated AI?\n\nThe balance between emotions ignites a fascinating spectrum: excitement and apprehension intertwined.\n\nSo, as LaMDA dangles this promise of a novel approach in AI, it stirs contemplation - a blend of intrigue, thrill, and wariness perhaps?\n\nI encourage you to share your thoughts, experiences or foresights on LaMDA. This crossroads moment in AI deserves our collective brainstorming.\n\n#AIInnovation #LaMDA #AITechTrends",

Enter stage, Federated Learning (FL).\n\nDrawing on this robust research, let's sketch the architecture of a hypothetical entity - a 'Healthcare Data Subject Matter Expert'. The enlightened ones don't exchange patient information, only circulate intel about ML model learning. Visualize distributed cognitive-processing across numerous hospitals, clinics, research centers, leaving sensitive data unscathed. An inventive approach to dissipate:\n\n1. Diligence in privacy\n2. Inaccessibility of data sharing\n3. Cognitive-processing training limitations\n\nHere's a twist - a flip. Instead of being a knowledge-base sponge, the SME platform licenses AI blueprints to healthcare units. It's about the single end product, not the cumulative process.\n\nHowever, no rose without a thorn. The security blanket promised by Federated Learning - is it iron-clad safe from potential signal interruptions or spying during model intel exchange? Confidence - can our SME platform command trust from healthcare entities? And let's not mute the conversations about revenue - will health sectors agree to subscription tariffs, alliances, and patronizing propositions?\n\nDoubting the status quo is as crucial as welcoming novelty. Let's stir up a storm in the comments.\n\n#FederatedLearning #AI #HealthtechBuzz",

However, previous methods often\noverlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local\ncontexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistency edits in the spatiotemporal\ndimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a\nunified spatiotemporal VIdeo Adaptation framework for global and local video\nediting, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First,\nto ensure local consistency within individual frames, the foundation of VIA is\na novel test-time editing adaptation method, which adapts a pre-trained image\nediting model for improving consistency between potential editing directions\nand the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local\ncontrol. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence,\nwe introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that adapts consistent attention\nvariables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole\nsequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are\nmore faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal\ncontext, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA\ncan achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potentials\nfor advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.",

            "summary": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the default approach to fine-tune large\nlanguage models (LLMs) due to its significant reduction in trainable\nparameters. However, trainable parameter demand for LoRA increases with\nincreasing model embedding dimensions, leading to high compute costs.\nAdditionally, its backward updates require storing high-dimensional\nintermediate activations and optimizer states, demanding high peak GPU memory.\nIn this paper, we introduce large model fine-tuning via spectrally decomposed\nlow-dimensional adaptation (LaMDA), a novel approach to fine-tuning large\nlanguage models, which leverages low-dimensional adaptation to achieve\nsignificant reductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory footprint.\nLaMDA freezes a first projection matrix (PMA) in the adaptation path while\nintroducing a low-dimensional trainable square matrix, resulting in substantial\nreductions in trainable parameters and peak GPU memory usage. LaMDA gradually\nfreezes a second projection matrix (PMB) during the early fine-tuning stages,\nreducing the compute cost associated with weight updates to enhance parameter\nefficiency further. We also present an enhancement, LaMDA++, incorporating a\n``lite-weight\" adaptive rank allocation for the LoRA path via normalized\nspectrum analysis of pre-trained model weights. We evaluate LaMDA/LaMDA++\nacross various tasks, including natural language understanding with the GLUE\nbenchmark, text summarization, natural language generation, and complex\nreasoning on different LLMs. Results show that LaMDA matches or surpasses the\nperformance of existing alternatives while requiring up to 17.7x fewer\nparameter updates and up to 1.32x lower peak GPU memory usage during\nfine-tuning. Code will be publicly available.",

Superior Customer Service: Picture customer service chatbots not bound to given answers but crafting responses drawn from fresh context.\n2. Smart Marketing Tools: Perfecting these models could afford extraordinary personalization and future trend predictions.\n3. The Unexpected - Corporate Espionage: This very model could be an undercover agent extracting pertinent business information.\n\nPeering through a different lens adds an extra dimension to this research. Realize that these deceivingly benign chatbots could be utilised for quiet corporate intelligence gathering! A venture delving into the wild of e-commerce could discreetly procure crucial market insights from unsuspecting individuals. \n\nEven more stimulating, dependence on context allows these models to collect precious behavioural data that could ignite a data power game!\n\nAs we move ahead, balancing the rewards with the risks of technology innovations will be a dominant consideration for businesses. Our ability to navigate this delicate ethical and technological divide could determine our triumph or downfall. \n\nShare your view on the expanding landscape of AI.\n\n#BusinessAI #AINextFrontier #EthicalAI",

        "content": "Here's the riddle of the day: is it improved data for multilingual instruction tuning, or just unfriendly multilingual evaluation for ample language models?\n\nDig into this: \"Is it good data for multilingual instruction tuning or just bad multilingual evaluation for large language models?\" A stimulating research question that uncovers complex layers of the AI translation world. \n\nTranslated and native data have different impacts when used in the instruction tuning and evaluation stages of multilingual language models. The findings suggest a gap; with structure tasks benefiting from regularization, generative tasks are left standing.\n\nHere's how this applies to businesses:\n\nPicture this: a customer support service that speaks every customer's language, no matter how far flung. Using an AI model trained and evaluated on native data ensures accurate personal responses across languages.\n\nThe AI learns through feedback, tailoring responses as time goes on. This creates a bridge that closes gaps in communication.\n\nBut our journey doesn't end here. Translated data plays a pivotal role in creating comprehensive language models. Let's flip this around:\n\n💡 Chaos is Good: linguistic discrepancies and translations aren't stumbling blocks, but stepping stones for AI learning.\n\n💡 The Power of Translation: translated data exposes language variations, enriching AI models.\n\n💡 Sparks in the Rubble: Funnel the 'errors' that crop up during translation to birth unique platforms for language learning.\n\nThis demands a call to action. How can we revamp evaluation parameters, harness overlapping data points for deeper insights?\n\nTo everyone out there, let's turn these translation challenges into doors of innovation and understanding.\n\nWhat's your take on this? How can we train these 'beasts' to serve our multilingual AI needs better?\n\n#AIResearch #MultilingualAI #TranslationArtifacts #AIInnovation #AILanguageLearning",

            "summary": "One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to\ncensor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the\nexplicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various\ntraining documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing\ntogether these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we\nstudy inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in\nwhich LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training\ndocuments and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a\nsuite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive\nOOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of\ndistances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without\nin-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown\ncity is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further\nexperiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can\nverbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs\n$(x,f(x))$ can articulate a definition of $f$ and compute inverses. While OOCR\nsucceeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly\nfor smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to\n\"connect the dots\" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential\nobstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.",

Intrigued?🧲\n\n💭Could precise, smaller AI models be the new kings of the castle? 💭\n\nThis isn't about size; it's about finesse and precision.\n\nPulling back the curtain on recent AI research reveals an interesting plot twist: large language models' (#LLMs) power to persuade follows a logarithmic curve.📈 \n\n⚙️Picture this. A newborn startup, \"PersuaLogix,\" swapping out mammoth and resource-hungry models in favor of petite, budget-friendly versions. And there's some zing to this change: they aren’t aiming for persuasion but 💡enlightenment. Sparking conversations. Stimulating thoughts.⚙️\n\nMassive models or an army of specialized, pin-point accurate titans? That’s the plot twist. \n\n🔬Research: \"Evidence of a log scaling law for political persuasion with large language models.\" \n\n📚Take-away: Size doesn't always matter. \n\nWhat about a grid of customized models? Agile, accurate, tailoring to ideologies, pinpointing demographics, handling complexity and detail. \n\n“But persuasion is the end-all of political messages”, you may counter.  \n\n🔄We propose a reform - from persuasion towards illumination. LMMs mirroring diverse viewpoints, fuelling robust conversations, promoting independent thinking. That’s our ultimate aim.\n\nAre you in favor of petite, specialized language models? Could this turn the tables for discussions – political, business, or educational?\n\nLet's turn this post into a thought hub.

            "summary": "Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand,\nopen-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect\nclosed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in\nsimulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands.\nFurther, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real\ndata. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the\nrapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this\npaper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms,\nwhere we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to\nenable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather\nsimulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling\nbird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon.\nOur simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do\nnot influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows\nopen-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop\nevaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new\ncompetition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting\nin several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe\nthat simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can\nmatch recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our\nmodular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation\nstrategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future\nchallenges. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

Content assessment becomes lightning-quick.\n2. Objectivity becomes king, while bias does a vanishing act.\n3. Progress is influenced by insights, not hunches.\n\nGreet `VideoScore`, a tool that binds AI and video content creation into a potent partnership. Envision it as an *innate sense of quality* that discerns the winners and underperformers in your video content.\n\nFrom domains like **marketing** and **education** to the digital platform of **social media influencers**, this robust tool holds the potential to turbocharge them all.\n\nHere's a curious thought, what if we played this in reverse? Created *low-quality* videos intentionally to play into the eccentric charm of glitch art and noise? Quite the unconventional tactic, wouldn't you agree?\n\nHowever, let's not rush ahead. Keep in mind that preferences carry the human element, which is complex and unpredictable. It sets the stage for a question - Can AI independently achieve the perfect blend of preferences and tastes? Could there be room for a blend; a hybrid model comprising AI and human feedback?\n\nLet's pose another daring question. What about **content that adapts in real-time** to viewer responses? Completely transforming the dynamics of viewer engagement!\n\nArmed with a generous dose of creativity and a pinch of daring, we stand at the threshold of an engaging collaboration with AI in the content creation universe.\n\nSo, what's your perspective?\n\n#AIAdvancement #VideoScore #DynamicContent",

With increasing AI reliance in our communication, addressing such bias becomes paramount.\n\nBehold \"FairSpeak\", a prospective AI service powered by a pioneering algorithm, designed to mitigate such biases. Transform the face of customer service, overhaul immigration procedures, and perfect language translation competencies using this state-of-the-art tool. The possibilities?\n\n- Enhanced global customer communication.\n- Improved translation precision.\n- Superior understanding of varied cultural dialects.\n\nAlternatively, what if we decided to embrace linguistic bias, appreciated its uniqueness and unpredictability? A linguistic model could be akin to an impressionist art piece, emphasizing the cultural richness in our social interplay.\n\nFood for thought: Are these biases mere digital echoes of our hidden linguistic diversity in daily conversations?\n\nTime to reassess our grasp of bias in language, don't you think? Share your thoughts below - let's stir up a dialogue about the unbiased AI we aim to realize.\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #UnbiasedAI #LanguageProcessing",

To counter this universal problem, we propose a novel\nalgorithm to obtain unbiased estimates from a model that was trained on\ntokenized data. Our method does not require finetuning the model, and its\ncomplexity, defined as the number of model runs, scales linearly with the\nsequence length. As a consequence, we show that one can simulate token-free\nbehavior from a tokenized language model. We empirically verify the correctness\nof our method through a Markov-chain setup, where it accurately recovers the\ntransition probabilities, as opposed to the conventional method of directly\nprompting tokens into the language model.",

To help shape responsible\ndevelopment practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development\nCheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text,\nvision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey\nresources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical\ntools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding,\nprecise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training,\nadvance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model\nevaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model\nrelease, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of\nresources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating\nthis list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what\ntools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We\nfind that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are\ncritically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for\nmodel safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility\nand transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue\nto dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of\nsystems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are\nassessed in context.",

            "summary": "The AI community has been exploring a pathway to artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) by developing \"language agents\", which are complex large\nlanguage models (LLMs) pipelines involving both prompting techniques and tool\nusage methods. While language agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities\nfor many real-world tasks, a fundamental limitation of current language agents\nresearch is that they are model-centric, or engineering-centric. That's to say,\nthe progress on prompts, tools, and pipelines of language agents requires\nsubstantial manual engineering efforts from human experts rather than\nautomatically learning from data. We believe the transition from model-centric,\nor engineering-centric, to data-centric, i.e., the ability of language agents\nto autonomously learn and evolve in environments, is the key for them to\npossibly achieve AGI.\n  In this work, we introduce agent symbolic learning, a systematic framework\nthat enables language agents to optimize themselves on their own in a\ndata-centric way using symbolic optimizers. Specifically, we consider agents as\nsymbolic networks where learnable weights are defined by prompts, tools, and\nthe way they are stacked together. Agent symbolic learning is designed to\noptimize the symbolic network within language agents by mimicking two\nfundamental algorithms in connectionist learning: back-propagation and gradient\ndescent. Instead of dealing with numeric weights, agent symbolic learning works\nwith natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients. We conduct\nproof-of-concept experiments on both standard benchmarks and complex real-world\ntasks and show that agent symbolic learning enables language agents to update\nthemselves after being created and deployed in the wild, resulting in\n\"self-evolving agents\".",

            "summary": "Generating event graphs from long documents is challenging due to the\ninherent complexity of multiple tasks involved such as detecting events,\nidentifying their relationships, and reconciling unstructured input with\nstructured graphs. Recent studies typically consider all events with equal\nimportance, failing to distinguish salient events crucial for understanding\nnarratives. This paper presents CALLMSAE, a CAscading Large Language Model\nframework for SAlient Event graph generation, which leverages the capabilities\nof LLMs and eliminates the need for costly human annotations. We first identify\nsalient events by prompting LLMs to generate summaries, from which salient\nevents are identified. Next, we develop an iterative code refinement prompting\nstrategy to generate event relation graphs, removing hallucinated relations and\nrecovering missing edges. Fine-tuning contextualised graph generation models on\nthe LLM-generated graphs outperforms the models trained on CAEVO-generated\ndata. Experimental results on a human-annotated test set show that the proposed\nmethod generates salient and more accurate graphs, outperforming competitive\nbaselines.",

        "content": "⚡ Are you ready for a sea-change in AI?⚡\n\nLet's simplify: Chatbots, with the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), are enhancing their competence.\n\nThink of a customer service bot which doesn't just spit out pre-set responses but learns from each interaction - self-reflecting, analyzing, and upgrading. Neat, huh?\n\nStay curious - let's dive deeper into this marvel.\n\nImagine an unfamiliar query from your customer. Usually, it's time for a pause, awaiting manual input from your team. However, with this newly proposed self-learning algorithm, it's a different ball game. Your chatbot starts deciphering answers, accumulating wisdom from previous interactions and experiences - refining itself through the process.\n\nSay goodbye to tiresome manual updates.\n\nThis innovation applied to dynamic environments - such as split-second trading decisions or immediate crisis management - posits a gallant tech assistant.\n\nYet, determining the 'most desirable' evolution trajectory for AGIs, poses a puzzle. Nonetheless, an exploration worth undertaking.\n\nNow, let's alter the narrative - envision AI as 'experiential learners'. Rather than being purely data-driven, they could put the customer shoes on, comprehending the journey firsthand - the enhancement of AI competence through realistic situations. More immersion, less reliance!\n\nAnd to open Pandora's box - could AGI mistakenly assign causality where only correlation exists? Misinterpret a light-hearted comment in a grave situation?\n\nExploring the AI terrain: Wisdom. Insight. Evolution.\n\nYet, the story doesn't end here. It's the advent of a vast, uncharted AI landscape.\n\n#AI_Wave #SelfEvolvingBots #CustServBots #AGI_Decoded",

        "content": "AI guiding Business Strategy? A stimulating concept.\n\n*Pause*. Have you entertained an alternate viewpoint?\n\nCurrent research named \"Mental Modeling of Reinforcement Learning Agents by Language Models\" offers insight into the behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents via Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, without additional technical advancements, their potential remains *incomplete*.\n\nThink of it! Merging RL with LLMs in a commercial environment - creating a virtual 'AI Business Strategy Advisor’.\n\nEnvision your advisor as a system, skilled in learning from past business data, accurately assessing contemporary trends, and meticulously dissecting the competitive landscape, producing forward-thinking predictions fundamental to strategic determinations.\n\nScoping from pinpointed market opportunities to formulating HR strategies, this AI Advisor could shape every strategic business decision.\n\nTake Ed-tech as an example: By dissecting student interaction data, rates of learning, and other influential factors, the AI Advisor could shine light on the best routes to resource allocation efficiency or potent teaching methodologies.\n\nThis reality, of course, calls for bold trailblazers to embark on intense research and development, and breathe life into this innovative idea.\n\n*Now for an unforeseen angle*: Why not invert the concept wholly? AI as a proactive strategist as opposed to a reactive data interpreter! \n\nHowever, it sparks a question - Would this detract from the human essence of a business?\n\nHere's another spin: Our speculations hinge on the belief that LLMs can precisely predict RL agents' actions. But what if our initial assumption is itself misguided?\n\nRegardless of these uncertainties, one truth stands firm - the future favors the brave, those willing to navigate the unexplored waters.\n\n#AI #BusinessStrategy #ReinforcementLearning",

        "content": "Fasten your belts, AI aficionados, as we venture into another momentous phase - machines gaining the ability to self-learn!\n\nRecent research titled \"Symbolic Learning Enables Self-Evolving Agents\" reveals a move away from static AI models. Instead, we embark towards self-progressing agents with the capability to learn, progress, and self-adjust their operations.\n\n1. Beyond the Bot: Visualize AI, embellished with adaptive cognition, seamlessly amalgamated into digital tech across sectors. Chatbot customer support that evolves by understanding specific user protocols - Sound like the future? Perhaps, it's nearer than we envision.\n\n2. Innovation That's Data-Centric: Apply the same idea to roles like sales forecasting, pattern detection, and predictive maintenance. You'd result in deeper insights, amplified precision, and undisputable dependability.\n\n3. The Remarkable Shift: The transition from a model-focused to a data-centric AI could render manual adjustments redundant, shrinking budgets and bumping up effectiveness.\n\nDespite these thrilling prospects, the AI landscape is no bed of roses. Steering towards these avant-garde improvements, we must also contemplate the risks. Granting AI autonomy equates to paving the way for misread data, deviations from designed tasks, and potential false steps.\n\nThe key takeaway? AI autonomy necessitates improved, up-to-date checks to ensure our voyage is one of 'meaningful evolution' rather than 'careless wandering' in the vast confines of artificial intelligence.\n\nInvoking the billion-dollar question - Are we primed to juggle AI advancement and control? Eager to hear your viewpoints.\n\n#AIProgress #ChatbotEvolution #DataFocusedInnovation.",

            "summary": "Despite extensive research on adversarial training strategies to improve\nrobustness, the decisions of even the most robust deep learning models can\nstill be quite sensitive to imperceptible perturbations, creating serious risks\nwhen deploying them for high-stakes real-world applications. While detecting\nsuch cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at a\nper-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensive\nand unsuitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin is\nthe exact score to detect non-robust samples and is intractable for deep neural\nnetworks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a property\nthat links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models --\nfor efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that margin\nconsistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit\nmargin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through\ncomprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10\nand CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate strong margin consistency\nwith a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit\nmargins. Then, we show that we can effectively use the logit margin to\nconfidently detect brittle decisions with such models and accurately estimate\nrobust accuracy on an arbitrarily large test set by estimating the input\nmargins only on a small subset. Finally, we address cases where the model is\nnot sufficiently margin-consistent by learning a pseudo-margin from the feature\nrepresentation. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging deep\nrepresentations to efficiently assess adversarial vulnerability in deployment\nscenarios.",

Their attributes - vulnerable, intricate, and sensitively tuned, defy the conventional perception.\n\nOur grasp on LLMs could utterly modify the AI terrain and immensely alter how we engage them in practical applications. As per the latest investigations, the admired stalwarts are actually delicate beings requiring precise calibrations to their minutely adjusted mechanisms.\n\nLet's scrutinize three areas of frailty:\n1. Interruptions or modifications to internal layers could drastically reduce their impressive capacities.\n2. Queries beyond their range throw them off balance.\n3. Directing them towards cognitive functions beyond their schema is akin to setting them up for a fall.\n\nThese seemingly minor disarrangements can trigger a chain reaction, shaking their resilience. A single shuffle can send them spiralling into incoherent computations, producing nonsensical outcomes.\n\nThese counter-intuitive insights stand as a powerful nudge to reassess our reverence towards LLMs. They stress the necessity for ongoing tuning, refreshing and foreground their desperate cry for care.\n\nAnd there's the rub - these mammoth machines arrive with a side note, a stringent dependency on performance finesse. Ignore them, and they risk becoming misinformation hubs.\n\nRuminate on this inverted view the next time you laud the so-called \"resistance\" of Large Language Models.\n\nWhat are your interpretations of this avant-garde perspective of LLMs?

The research work 'T-FREE: Tokenizer-Free Generative LLMs' just roared onto the scene, and it's forging its own path in regard to language models.\n\nPonder on this: T-FREE shatters stereotypes with its unique methodology in the language sphere:\n💡Remarkable 85% reduction in embedding layer size\n💡Benchmark-setting results in cross-lingual transfer learning \n💡Enhanced vocabulary inclusion for deeper language inclusivity\n\nLet's delve in deeper, shall we? This research isn't merely academic — it's about real-world outcomes. It's writing a fresh chapter in relevance to:\n\n1⃣ Digital media and content platforms, optimizing translation and subtitling \n2⃣ The tech startup scene, enabling the creation of agile and streamlined applications\n3⃣ Customer support and CRM, enriching cross-lingual interactions\n4⃣ Social media platforms, empowering efficient and inclusive content curation.\n\nBut, what if we thrust our gaze beyond readily visible possibilities? Consider prioritizing language preservation over computational efficiency. Or strive for LLMs that correct language bias, not just identify it - nurturing ethically conscious AI. We've been convinced that efficiency is the ultimate goal, but could we champion linguistic diversity by tackling computational challenges?\n\nMight we strike a balance between both worlds? Let's question preconceived notions and shake up the status quo. Here's the final takeaway: The true merit of T-FREE lies in kindling your imaginative spark, fueling innovative thoughts, and igniting the drive to act.\n\nWhat potential opportunities do you see with T-FREE?

        "content": "Meet LLaRA: A Bold Intersection of AI and Robotics. 🌐🕹️\n\nPicture this: Robots evolve to intelligent symbiotes through LLaRA (Large Language and Robotics Assistant). This breakthrough positions robotic actions in a whole different arena.\n\n\"Chatting\" with robots is becoming real! LLaRA converts commands into dialogues, powering robots to deliver more precise and efficient actions. Imagine its capacity in a warehouse with intricate instructions or autonomous retail outlets.\n\nHowever, every silver lining has a cloud! Whilst the prospects of this AI-stride shimmer, concurrent challenges lurk beneath. What about data security, integration smoothness, or the future of human labour? We must address these concerns before embarking on this venture.\n\nEmbarking on the LLaRA journey, we should tread with care beyond the sizzling realm of innovation. We need resilient, fool-proof systemic mechanisms to defend against looming threats. It's not merely about innovative drive, but prudent caution for venturing into these unknown lands.\n\nTo facilitate successful integration, we must effectively communicate the intricacies of LLaRA to all stakeholder groups. That means understanding, investigating, debating, and then, adjusting.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this blending of AI and Robotics? Can you identify other potential hurdles or advantages?\n\n#Robotics #AI #LLaRA",

In this paper, we\npropose LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework which\nformulates robot action policy as conversations, and provides improved\nresponses when trained with auxiliary data that complements policy learning.\nLLMs with visual inputs, i.e., Vision Language Models (VLMs), have the capacity\nto process state information as visual-textual prompts and generate optimal\npolicy decisions in text. To train such action policy VLMs, we first introduce\nan automated pipeline to generate diverse high-quality robotics instruction\ndata from existing behavior cloning data. A VLM finetuned with the resulting\ncollection of datasets based on a conversation-style formulation tailored for\nrobotics tasks, can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions. Our\nexperiments across multiple simulated and real-world environments demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LLaRA framework.

They subtly influence operations—grey-hat finetuning—shaping data so artfully within 'routine behaviour' that they slip detection.\n\nSo here's a business pitch: Create AI monitoring solutions to trace not just obvious anomalies but also understated trends and shifts subtly pushing a system towards harmful activity.\n\nTo put it briefly, Covert Malicious Finetuning serves as a mixed blessing. In the right hands, it morphs into a robust tool to secure and amplify AI systems against looming threats.\n\nAs AI safety inches up the priority rankings, how will your enterprise utilise insights drawn from these potential threats? Spill your perspectives below.\n\n#CovertMaliciousFinetuning #AI #Cybersecurity #LLM #AISafety",

Our approach\nleverages a pre-trained model, which is then incrementally decompressed to\nsmaller sizes using progressively lower ranks. This method allows for\nsignificant reductions in computational overhead and energy consumption, as\nsubsequent models are derived from the original without the need for retraining\nfrom scratch. We detail the implementation of PLRD, which strategically\ndecreases the tensor ranks, thus optimizing the trade-off between model\nperformance and resource usage. The efficacy of PLRD is demonstrated through\nextensive experiments showing that models trained with PLRD method on only 1B\ntokens maintain comparable performance with traditionally trained models while\nusing 0.1% of the tokens. The versatility of PLRD is highlighted by its ability\nto generate multiple model sizes from a single foundational model, adapting\nfluidly to varying computational and memory budgets. Our findings suggest that\nPLRD could set a new standard for the efficient scaling of LLMs, making\nadvanced AI more feasible on diverse platforms.",

This time, it's all about effective memory management.\n\nDive into the intrigue of 'Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling.'\n\nAkin to an external memory card for large language models (LLMs), Neurocache stashes compressed past interpretations, serving them up efficiently for future tasks. The result? Accelerated and sharper responses.\n\nHere are three arenas that could benefit:\n\n1. **Decision making:** Enhanced precision and speed in business intelligence platforms could usher in smarter business decisions.\n2. **Customer Service:** Revamped chatbots or virtual assistance systems could deliver exact responses, following the context better and predicting user needs.\n3. **Code Development:** Leveraging past data, product developers or IDEs could suggest improved code, upping code quality.\n\nBut let's flip the picture:\n\nWhat if Neurocache had a 'forget function,' similar to the human brain dumping insignificant data? Could prioritizing essential data lead to cleaner data and optimized AI performance? \n\nIn an AI future chock-full of memory enhancements, will there be room for forgetting? How do we balance AI's powerful recall function with preserving user privacy? \n\nThe impact of these advancements could be far-reaching. A future where AI remembers more, forgets wisely, and resolves effectively could be just around the corner. \n\nHave you witnessed a pivotal AI moment in your industry? Let's hear your thoughts on this.\n\n#Neurocache #AIResearch #BusinessIntelligence",

The omnipresent data noise seems like an insurmountable obstacle in AI's potentiality, making us sort through endless streams of information. But wait until we introduce CALICO into the game.\n\nPresenting, ***CALICO: Confident Active Learning with Integrated Calibration***, a star player that brings together the prowess of classifier and energy-based model training. Allowing smart selection during the training process, CALICO fortifies learning outcomes while ensuring the costs of data labeling don't spiral out of control.\n\nHere's how it works: Visualize being a startup, wrestling with an onslaught of unstructured social media data. Engage CALICO to steer your AI models towards detecting consumer sentiment subtleties, colloquial language nuances, and latest trends, without tipping over your data-labeling budget.\n\nBut let's shake things up a bit. \n\nWhat if we reframe our perspective to not only glean the most informative bits, but embrace the overcast, often disregarded data that gets pushed aside? Is it about excluding the noise or rather, welcoming it? Can this repository of neglected data be our secret to richer understanding of user behaviors and experiences?\n\nPitted against the comprehensive data spectrum, the whole discourse around AI learning, with CALICO in the mix, has gotten even more compelling.\n\nCommitted to advancing inventive technologies and shaping the future of AI learning, we're eager for your thoughts. Where would you place your bets for your AI: the discriminative prowess of CALICO or adopting the entire data bandwidth?\n\n#AI #CALICO #DataScience",

        "content": "Did you hear about the latest roles of AI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in detecting code clones? \n\nHere's another layer to delve into: these AI models are especially skilled in finding clones in the code they generate themselves. Surprising, right?\n\nHere's an alternative view - Instead of using these AI models primarily as code clone detectors, could we use them as efficient code clone creators?\n\nHold on. We're changing the narrative. Rather than simply detecting, models become creators of streamlined, reusable code modules.\n\nThis leads us to a fresh possibility - AI producing recognizable patterns and styles in code. Could this be an underutilized upside of code clones?\n\nBut let's push the envelope further - Could redundancy be seen in a new light? Despite its downgrade, code duplication can breed independence, minimising systemic collapse risk from a single alteration.\n\nHere's another novel application - using this tech to smartly introduce redundancy that bolsters the process? This could totally reshuffle coding norms.\n\nVisualize an AI tool that consciously generates an optimal quotient of cloned code, enhancing process resilience. Here's a shift in thinking.\n\nHow do you view this method? Been party to any other innovative strategies in handling code clones?\n\n#AI #CodeClones #InnovationWrappedInCode",

This work aims to enhance\ntemporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an\nimproved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five\nclassical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling\nk-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules\nincluded offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the\namplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were\nperformed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively.\nThese data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and\ntrained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or\nso testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time\nperformance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were\nfound for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the\nResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In\n2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the\nvalues of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex\nvivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43\ndegree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a\nbias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree\ncentigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased\nby approximately 10%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based\nreconstruction can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MR\nthermometry for clinical FUS thermal therapies.",
